// This translation unit provides the default behaviour for the base widget
// interface used by the terminal UI toolkit.  The definitions here establish
// a minimal contract for layout, painting, event handling, and focus so that
// derived widgets can override only the pieces they need.  No global state is
// touched, keeping the primitives straightforward to embed inside higher-level
// containers and applications.

///          to reference @ref rect_ when painting or dispatching events.  The

///          @ref render::ScreenBuffer passed from the compositor.  Keeping the
