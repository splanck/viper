// Defines the core container widgets used by the terminal UI framework.  The
// Container base class manages child lifetimes, painting order, and layout
// delegation, while the @ref VStack and @ref HStack specialisations compute
// simple equal-sized column and row arrangements.  These building blocks power
// higher-level layouts throughout the sample applications.
