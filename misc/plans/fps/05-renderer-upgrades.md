> (session A: E18 view-model pass + E19 sprite additive + E21 CopyTo; session B: E20 RT→material,
> E22 software instancing, E23 portal-frustum PVS). Eliminates constraints #10, #12, #13, #14,

> 13/14 weapons FX (additive sprites), 22-world-systems (instanced debris/foliage on SW).

## 0. TL;DR

Five renderer upgrades that FPS presentation needs: a **camera-space view-model pass** with its
own FOV and depth-range remap (weapon never clips walls, world FOV stays independent);
**additive blending on `Sprite3D`** (muzzle glows, tracers, EMP arcs); **zero-copy
render-target→material binding** (live security monitors, rail scope inset) plus an
allocation-free `CopyTo`; a **real instanced path in the software backend** (removes the
per-instance fallback and its trap cap); and **per-portal frustum clipping** so indoor PVS
culls tightly instead of conservatively.

## 1. Current state (verified anchors)

- No view-model support: nothing in `rt_canvas3d.c`/backends draws with a per-draw projection
  override or depth-range remap; games hand-roll near-camera transforms (clips geometry, shares
  world FOV).
- `Sprite3D` surface = New/SetPosition/SetScale/SetAnchor/SetFrame/RebaseOrigin + DrawSprite3D
  (runtime.def:16292-16305) — **no blend control**; `Particles3D` has `Additive` (RT_PROP,
  Particles3D class block).
- `RenderTarget3D.AsPixels` returns a **fresh Pixels copy every call** (`rt_rendertarget3d.c:19,329`);
  no way to bind an RT's color as a material texture — monitors require GPU→CPU→GPU round trips.
- SW instancing: no `submit_draw_instanced` hook in the SW vtable (`vgfx3d_backend_sw.c:549-556`);
  dispatch falls back to per-instance queued draws (`rt_canvas3d_instanced.inc:72-98,428-430`)
  and **traps** above `CANVAS3D_MAX_FALLBACK_INSTANCES` (`:431`).
- PVS: portal-reachability BFS marks every zone reachable through any portal — no frustum
  narrowing (`rt_scene3d_helpers.inc:1775-1825`; zone/portal structs
  `rt_scene3d_internal.h:132-240`).

## 2. Design

### E18 — View-model pass
```text
Viper.Graphics3D.Canvas3D.BeginViewModelPass(f64,f64,f64)  void(obj,f64,f64,f64)
    — (fovYDegrees, depthMin, depthMax): subsequent DrawMesh/DrawMeshSkinned calls render
      with a dedicated projection (own FOV, canvas aspect, near 0.01) and their depth output
      remapped into [depthMin,depthMax] (typical 0.0–0.05) so they always pass the depth test
      against world geometry yet self-occlude correctly.
Viper.Graphics3D.Canvas3D.EndViewModelPass()               void(obj)
```
- Implementation: draws inside the pass are tagged; backends set viewport depth range
  (Metal `MTLViewport.znear/zfar`, D3D11 `D3D11_VIEWPORT.MinDepth/MaxDepth`, GL
  `glDepthRangef`) and swap the projection constant — **no shader changes needed** on GPU
  backends. Software: raster path scales interpolated depth into the remap window.
  Pass renders **after opaque world, before transparents/particles** so world post-FX
  (SSAO etc.) doesn't smear the weapon; lighting uses the world light set at camera position.
- Constraints documented: shadows are not cast by view-model draws (tag skips shadow pass);
  motion vectors use the pass projection (TAA-safe).

### E19 — Sprite3D additive
`Sprite3D.set_Additive(i1)` → sprite draw command carries blend mode; backends select the
existing additive blend state already used by `Particles3D` (all four have it). Also add
`Sprite3D.SetColor(i64)` tint (RGBA) — muzzle glow needs per-flash color; verified absent today.

### E20 — Zero-copy RT→material
```text
Viper.Graphics3D.Material3D.SetAlbedoRenderTarget(obj)  void(obj,obj)  — bind RT color as albedo
Viper.Graphics3D.Material3D.ClearAlbedoRenderTarget()   void(obj)
```
- GPU backends: material samples the RT's native color texture (Metal `id<MTLTexture>`,
  D3D11 SRV, GL texture id) — zero copies. Hazard rule: binding the **currently bound** RT as
  a source is refused per draw (validation → skip draw + `AssetDiagnostics3D` warning), matching
  D3D11 simultaneous-bind rules; games render monitors first, then the main scene.
- Software: material samples the RT's CPU buffer directly (shared pointer, no copy).
- Emissive variant `SetEmissiveRenderTarget` included (monitors glow in dark rooms).

### E21 — `RenderTarget3D.CopyTo(pixels)` `void(obj,obj)`
Reuses caller's Pixels (dims must match, else trap with exact message
`"RenderTarget3D.CopyTo: size mismatch"`); no allocation; same readback path as AsPixels.

### E22 — Software instancing
Add `submit_draw_instanced` to the SW vtable: iterate instances in the backend inner loop
(transform reuse, no per-instance command overhead), honoring the same instance data layout
(`backend.h` instanced payload). Remove the fallback trap: `CANVAS3D_MAX_FALLBACK_INSTANCES`
becomes a soft telemetry counter (`get_InstancedFallbackCount`) — blended-material and rebase
cases still fall back but never trap. Capability `"instancing"` becomes true on SW (it now has
the hook); `"hardware_instancing"` stays GPU-only (renamed semantics documented).

### E23 — Portal-frustum PVS
Replace the flat BFS with recursive portal traversal: starting from the camera zone with the
camera frustum, for each portal in the current zone visible against the **current** frustum,
compute the narrowed frustum through the portal quad (clip frustum planes to the portal's
screen-space bounds — classic portal culling) and recurse into the connected zone with it.
Zones collect the union of narrowed frusta for draw culling. Depth cap 8, degenerate-portal
guard (min area), fallback to old BFS via `SceneGraph.SetPortalClipping(i1)` (default on).
Telemetry: existing `get_PvsCulledCount` now reflects tighter culling; add
`get_PortalTraversalCount`.

## 4. Tests

1. View-model golden (SW): weapon box at z=0.3 inside a wall at z=0.2 → weapon fully visible,
   world unaffected; FOV 54 pass over FOV 90 world → projection assert via golden.
   Depth-remap unit: remapped depths all < world min depth.
2. Sprite additive golden: two overlapping additive sprites sum toward white; tint applies.
3. RT→material: render red triangle to RT, bind as albedo on a quad, render main scene →
   quad shows triangle (SW golden + Metal manual); self-bind refused with warning;
   monitor loop 60 frames → zero Pixels allocations (allocation counter probe).
4. CopyTo: dims mismatch traps with exact message; matched dims → identical bytes to AsPixels.
5. SW instancing: 10,000-instance batch renders (was trap) — golden matches 10k individual
   draws reference at reduced size; draw-submission counter shows 1; fallback counter 0.
6. Portal clipping: corridor of 4 zones in a line, camera looking down it → all visible;
   camera rotated 90° → only current zone visible (`PvsCulledCount` rises); portal behind
   camera culls its subtree. Toggle off restores BFS results (regression compat).
7. Existing `test_rt_scene3d.cpp` zone tests stay green.

## 5. Verification gate

`ctest -R 'canvas3d|scene3d|rendertarget|sprite'` + `-L graphics3d` → goldens committed →
runtime completeness + surface audits + ADR → full no-skip build → Metal manual pass:
view-model weapon over L4-style corridor with monitors live at 60 FPS, no allocation growth
over 5 minutes (Instruments spot-check). GL/D3D11 paths compile-clean via lint; exercised in
the P4/P12 platform lanes.
