# Enforce LF line endings on checkout for all text files (MED-5).
# This prevents golden test CRLF/LF mismatches on Windows where
# git core.autocrlf=true would otherwise convert committed LF files to CRLF.

# Auto-detect text/binary; default text files to LF.
* text=auto eol=lf

# Explicitly binary — never touch line endings.
