Initial import of the Viper project with the core scaffolding checked in. Architecture documentation outlines the planned IL, VM, and codegen layers, and an early test harness is wired up to keep future changes honest.

A beginner-friendly IL Quickstart tutorial was added. It introduces core IL concepts with runnable snippets and links from the overview and IL reference so newcomers know where to start.
