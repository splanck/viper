//
// Implements the focus management subsystem for the terminal UI toolkit.  The
// focus manager owns the traversal ring that keeps track of focusable widgets,
// providing registration, removal, and navigation helpers.  It does not own the
// widgets themselves, allowing layout containers to maintain lifetime control
// while this module orchestrates focus changes and the associated callbacks.
