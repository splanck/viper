// File: tui/src/app.cpp
// Purpose: Implement the minimal headless application driver that powers the
//          Viper terminal UI toolkit.
// Key invariants: Each tick drains queued input events exactly once, applies
//                 focus changes prior to widget dispatch, and renders a fresh
//                 frame into the backing screen buffer.
// Ownership/Lifetime: App owns the widget tree, focus manager, and screen
//                     buffer; it borrows the terminal I/O backend supplied by
//                     the embedder.

///          6. Emit the diff through the renderer and snapshot the frame for
///             the next iteration.
