// This file declares the FocusManager class for Viper's TUI. The focus
// manager maintains a circular ring of focusable widgets and tracks which
// widget currently has keyboard focus.
//
// Widgets register with the focus manager via registerWidget(). Only widgets
// that return true from wantsFocus() are added to the ring. The focus
// manager supports Tab-style navigation via next() and prev(), which cycle
// through the ring and return the newly focused widget.
//
// The App calls next()/prev() in response to Tab/Shift+Tab key events and
// notifies widgets of focus changes via Widget::onFocusChanged().
//
// Key invariants:
//   - The ring contains only widgets with wantsFocus() == true.
//   - current() returns nullptr when the ring is empty.
//   - Unregistering the currently focused widget adjusts the index safely.
//
// Ownership: FocusManager stores non-owning raw pointers to widgets. The
// widgets must outlive their registration in the manager.
