// This file declares the Container base class and the VStack/HStack layout
// containers for Viper's TUI. Container provides a common base for widgets
// that manage a collection of child widgets, handling ownership, painting
// delegation, and layout orchestration.
//
// VStack arranges children vertically (top to bottom), dividing the
// available height equally among children. HStack does the same
// horizontally (left to right) with available width.
//
// Key invariants:
//   - Children are owned exclusively via unique_ptr.
//   - Paint iterates children in insertion order (front-to-back).
//   - layoutChildren() is called after the container's own rect is set.
//
// Ownership: Container owns all children via unique_ptr. The container
// must outlive any external references to its children.
