// File: src/frontends/basic/ast/StmtNodes.hpp
// Purpose: Legacy umbrella header maintained for downstream compatibility.
// Key invariants: Delegates to StmtNodesAll.hpp which aggregates every statement
//                 family header.
// Ownership/Lifetime: Statements follow ownership rules documented in family headers.
