/// @file ImportResolver.hpp
/// @brief Recursive import resolver for the Zia frontend.
///
/// @details The ImportResolver handles the `bind` statement in Zia source code.
/// When a module contains `bind SomeModule;`, the resolver locates the
/// corresponding `.zia` file, parses it into an AST, recursively resolves its
/// own imports, and prepends the imported declarations into the importing
/// module's AST. This ensures that all imported symbols (functions, types,
/// constants) are visible during semantic analysis and lowering.
///
/// The resolution algorithm uses a depth-first traversal with cycle handling:
///   1. Normalize the import path to a canonical form.
///   2. Check if the file is already fully processed (skip) or in-progress
///      (circular bind — skip without error).
///   3. Mark the file as in-progress and push it onto the import stack.
///   4. Parse the file using the Zia lexer and parser.
///   5. Recursively resolve any imports within the parsed module.
///   6. Prepend the resolved declarations into the importing module.
///   7. Mark the file as fully processed and pop the import stack.
///
/// Safety limits prevent runaway compilation: kMaxImportDepth (50) bounds
/// recursion depth and kMaxImportedFiles (100) bounds total file count.
///
/// @invariant processedFiles_ and inProgressFiles_ are disjoint at all times.
/// @invariant importStack_ mirrors the current recursion path (depth == stack size).
/// @invariant A file in processedFiles_ will never be parsed or processed again.
///
/// Ownership/Lifetime: Stack-allocated, lives for the duration of a single
/// compilation. Holds references to the shared DiagnosticEngine and
/// SourceManager which must outlive this object.
///
/// @see Compiler.hpp — orchestrates parsing, import resolution, sema, lowering.
/// @see AST.hpp — ModuleDecl and other AST node types produced by parsing.
/// @see Parser.hpp — the Zia parser invoked by parseFile().
