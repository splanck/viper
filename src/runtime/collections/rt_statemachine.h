// File: src/runtime/collections/rt_statemachine.h
// Purpose: Finite state machine with up to RT_STATE_MAX (32) registered states, tracking current state, frame count, and one-frame enter/exit transition flags.
//
// Key invariants:
//   - State IDs must be in [0, RT_STATE_MAX-1]; each ID may be registered once.
//   - Transition flags (just_entered/just_exited) are set on transition and persist until cleared.
//   - rt_statemachine_update must be called once per frame to advance the frame counter.
//   - Initial state must be set before the first update call.
//
// Ownership/Lifetime:
//   - Caller owns the rt_statemachine handle; destroy with rt_statemachine_destroy.
//   - No reference counting; explicit destruction is required.
