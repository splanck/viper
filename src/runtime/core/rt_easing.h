// File: src/runtime/core/rt_easing.h
// Purpose: Easing functions for animation and interpolation implementing Robert Penner conventions, providing linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, exponential, circular, back, elastic, and bounce variants.
//
// Key invariants:
//   - Input t is expected in [0.0, 1.0]; behavior outside this range is unspecified.
//   - f(0.0) = 0.0 and f(1.0) = 1.0 for all standard easing functions.
//   - Back and elastic variants may produce output outside [0, 1] due to overshoot.
//   - All functions use double precision IEEE-754 arithmetic.
//
// Ownership/Lifetime:
//   - All functions are pure and stateless; no allocation or side effects.
//   - Parameters and return values are plain double; no ownership transfer.
//
