// File: src/runtime/io/rt_binfile.c
// Purpose: Implements binary file stream operations for the Viper.IO.BinFile
//          class. Supports random-access read and write of raw bytes, integers,
//          and floats at 64-bit precision, with multi-byte values in
//          little-endian byte order.
//
// Key invariants:
//   - Open modes: "r" (read-only), "w" (write/truncate), "rw" (read-write),
//     "a" (append). Invalid modes cause a trap.
//   - 64-bit seek/tell are used (fseeko/ftello on POSIX, _fseeki64 on Win32)
//     to support files larger than 2GB.
//   - EOF flag is set after a read returns zero bytes; it is sticky until seek.
//   - All multi-byte integer writes use little-endian byte order.
//   - The closed flag prevents double-close; operations on a closed file trap.
//
// Ownership/Lifetime:
//   - BinFile objects are heap-allocated; the GC calls the finalizer on collect.
//   - The finalizer flushes and closes the FILE* if not already closed.
//   - Returned rt_bytes from ReadBytes are fresh allocations owned by the caller.
//
// Links: src/runtime/io/rt_binfile.h (public API),
//        src/runtime/io/rt_stream.h (wraps BinFile behind a generic stream),
//        src/runtime/io/rt_memstream.h (in-memory counterpart)
