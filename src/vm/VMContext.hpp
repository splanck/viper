/**
 * @brief RAII guard that installs a VM as the thread-local active instance.
 *
 * ActiveVMGuard manages the thread-local `tlsActiveVM` pointer that enables
 * `VM::activeInstance()` to retrieve the currently executing VM. It also
 * binds the VM's runtime context via `rt_set_current_context()` so that
 * C runtime functions access the correct per-VM state.
 *
 * ## Thread-Local Semantics
 *
 * - On construction: saves the current `tlsActiveVM` and sets it to the new VM
 * - On destruction: restores the saved value (supports nesting)
 * - Each thread has its own `tlsActiveVM`, so concurrent threads can each
 *   have their own active VM without interference
 *
 * ## Debug Assertions
 *
 * In debug builds (`NDEBUG` not defined), the guard asserts that:
 * - **No re-entry**: If `tlsActiveVM` is already non-null and points to a
 *   *different* VM, an assertion fires. This catches accidental concurrent
 *   use of a VM from the same thread.
 * - **Consistent restore**: The destructor asserts that `tlsActiveVM` still
 *   points to the expected VM before restoring.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * @code
 *   {
 *       ActiveVMGuard guard(&myVM);
 *       // VM::activeInstance() now returns &myVM
 *       // rt_get_current_context() returns myVM.rtContext
 *       myVM.run();
 *   }  // guard destructor restores previous active VM
 * @endcode
 *
 * @invariant Restores the previous active VM value on destruction.
 * @invariant In debug builds, asserts on invalid re-entry patterns.
 * @ownership Does not own the VM pointer; lifetime is managed by the caller.
