// File: src/support/diag_capture.hpp
// Purpose: Provide a capture-only diagnostic sink to bridge legacy bool plus ostream APIs.
// Key invariants: Diagnostics recorded in the capture are printed verbatim and converted into error diagnostics on demand.
// Ownership/Lifetime: DiagCapture owns its string buffer; returned diagnostics copy the captured message text.
// Links: docs/class-catalog.md
