// File: src/support/diagnostics.cpp
// License: MIT License (c) 2024 The Viper Project Authors. See LICENSE in the

// Purpose: Implement the diagnostic engine that aggregates, counts, and prints
//          compiler diagnostics in a consistent format.
// Ownership/Lifetime: Engine owns stored diagnostics until cleared or destroyed.

/// @brief Houses the diagnostic aggregation engine shared across front-ends.
/// @details `il::support::DiagnosticEngine` acts as the canonical collector for
///          compiler diagnostics.  Translation units inject new diagnostics via
///          @ref report(), and tools can later print or query summary counts for
///          gating pipelines.  Centralising this logic ensures consistent
///          messaging independent of the originating subsystem.
