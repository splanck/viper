# Viper Architecture Overview

**Purpose:** This document explains how Viper compiles and runs programs end-to-end: front ends (e.g., BASIC) → intermediate language (IL) → optimization passes → execution on the VM interpreter → (future) native code generation. It merges prior overview notes and archived blueprints so contributors have a single map to the system; deep dives live in linked pages.

If you're new to the IL, start with the [IL Quickstart](il-quickstart.md).

## Project goals

- Multi-language front ends (begin with BASIC) that all lower to a common IL "thin waist."
- Interpreter backend that executes IL directly for fast bring-up, tests, and debugging.
- Native backend that translates IL to assembly (x86-64 SysV first), assembled and linked into runnable binaries.
- Small, solo-friendly codebase with clear module boundaries, strong tests, and a stable runtime ABI.

## High-level pipeline

The core stages and artifacts:

- **Front end (BASIC):** lex/parse → AST → semantic analysis (types, arity, lvalues).
- **Lowering:** AST → IL module (functions, blocks, instructions).
- **Optimization passes:** constant folding, dead code elimination, peephole rewriting.
- **Execution backends:**
  - **VM interpreter** (primary today).
  - **Code generation** (experimental, planned to target x86-64 SysV first).

   +----------------------+        +---------------------+
```

All languages feed the same IL builder, and both the VM and code generator consume that shared representation, keeping the IL as the thin waist between language-specific semantics and machine execution.

### End-to-end lifecycle

`ilc` is the command-line entry point. It parses arguments, loads source files, and drives the compile and execute pipeline:

1. BASIC front end emits IL.
2. `PassManager` applies optimizations.
3. Verifier checks invariants.
4. VM loads the module and runs `main`.

```sh
$ ilc run examples/basic/ex1_hello_cond.bas
HELLO
READY
10
10
```

When the native backend is enabled, the same IL feeds the code generator instead of the interpreter.

## Source layout (where things live)

- **Front end:** `src/frontends/basic/`.
- **IL core:** `src/il/core/`, `src/il/io/`, `src/il/build/`, `src/il/verify/`.
- **Passes:** `src/il/transform/`.
- **VM:** `src/vm/`, `src/runtime/`.
- **Code generation:** `src/codegen/`.
- **Support utilities:** `src/support/`.
- **Tools:** `src/tools/ilc/` (driver and subcommands), `src/tools/`.
- **Docs & examples:** `docs/`, `examples/`, `tests/` (`unit/`, `golden/`, `e2e/`).
- **Build system:** top-level `CMakeLists.txt`, `cmake/` helpers, `scripts/` for dev automation.

## Components & responsibilities

### Front end (BASIC)

The BASIC front end performs tokenization, parsing, semantic analysis, and lowering to IL. Tokens are produced by a hand-written lexer, and the recursive-descent parser builds an AST with nodes for statements and expressions.

Subcomponents and duties:

- **Lexer:** emits identifiers, numbers, strings, and keywords.
- **Parser:** produces the AST for BASIC constructs (e.g., `LET`, `PRINT`, `IF/THEN/ELSE`, `WHILE/WEND`, `GOTO`, `GOSUB/RETURN`).
- **Semantic analysis:** manages symbol tables, resolves types (`INT` vs `STRING`), enforces lvalue rules, performs simple constant folding, and handles suffix conventions such as `$` for strings.
- **Desugaring:** normalizes constructs (e.g., `ELSEIF` into nested `IF` blocks).
- **Lowering:** walks the AST and emits IL instructions via the IR builder.

Intrinsic functions like `LEN`, `LEFT$`, and `MID$` are looked up in a static registry during semantic analysis. They lower to runtime calls such as `rt_len` and `rt_substr`.

Diagnostics flow through `DiagnosticEmitter`, which tracks file and line information. Errors stop compilation before lowering, keeping the emitted IL well-formed.

### Intermediate Language (IL)

The IL is a typed, block-structured representation with SSA-like virtual registers. Functions contain labelled basic blocks ending in explicit terminators, and the verifier checks single terminators per block, operand types, and call signatures.

```text
+-------------------------------+
| IL Module                     |
|  - externs                    |
|  - globals                    |
|  - functions                  |
|     - blocks (phi/ops/term)   |
+-------------------------------+
```

Example:

```il
il 0.1.2
fn @main() -> i64 {
entry:
  %v0 = add 2, 2
  ret %v0
}
```

Key design points:

- **Types:** `i1`, `i32`, `i64`, `f64`, `ptr`, `str`; keep the set minimal and orthogonal.
- **Values:** virtual registers, constants, globals, function symbols; names are interned for determinism.
- **Instructions (v1 focus):** arithmetic (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`), bitwise ops, comparisons, control flow (`br`, `cbr`, `ret`, `trap`), memory ops (`alloca`, `load`, `store`, `gep`), calls, constant constructors, and minimal casts.
- **Metadata:** source locations, attributes, visibility, and string tables stored per module.
- **Calling convention:** by-value scalars with explicit pointers for aggregates; strings remain opaque handles manipulated through runtime helpers.

### Pass pipeline

`src/il/transform/PassManager` orchestrates the optimization pipeline. Passes run in a fixed order:

1. **ConstFold** – folds constant expressions.
2. **Peephole** – rewrites short instruction sequences.
3. **DCE** – removes unreachable code and unused values.

The verifier runs after passes to enforce correctness before execution or code generation.

### Runtime & ABI (externs)

Extern symbols in IL map to C functions declared in `src/runtime/rt.hpp`. Strings use reference-counted heap objects; numeric values are 64-bit.

Initial runtime surface (all prefixed `rt_`):

- Console: `rt_print_str`, `rt_print_i64`, `rt_print_f64`, `rt_input_line`.
- Strings: `rt_len`, `rt_concat`, `rt_substr`, `rt_to_int`, `rt_int_to_str`, `rt_f64_to_str`.
- Memory: `rt_alloc`, `rt_free`.
- Optional math helpers: `rt_sin`, `rt_cos`, `rt_pow`, etc.

#### Runtime memory model

Strings and arrays share a single heap layout described by [`rt_heap.h`](../src/runtime/rt_heap.h). Every payload pointer is preceded by an `rt_heap_hdr_t` header containing a magic tag, the allocation kind, the element kind, reference count, length, and capacity. The helper accessors in `rt_heap.c` validate this header on every retain/release in debug builds, ensuring both strings and arrays obey the same invariants.

Arrays are true reference types: assigning to another variable or passing as a parameter forwards the handle and bumps the refcount. No eager copy happens. When `rt_arr_i32_resize` observes a shared array (`refcnt > 1`) it allocates a fresh payload, copies the active prefix, releases the old handle, and returns the new pointer—effectively copy-on-resize. In-place growth only occurs when the array is uniquely owned.

Ownership rules mirror strings. The lowering pipeline emits retains on assignment boundaries, scope exit releases, parameter teardown releases, and function returns transfer ownership to the caller. Violating these rules (e.g., releasing then reusing a temp in the same block) is caught by the IL verifier.

Define `VIPER_RC_DEBUG=1` (set automatically for Debug builds) or export the environment variable `VIPER_RC_DEBUG` to make the runtime log every retain/release along with the resulting refcount. These checks highlight double releases, missing retains, or stale handles early in development.

Additional runtime details live in the [Runtime & VM Guide](runtime-vm.md#runtime-memory-model).

Front-end intrinsics lower directly to these routines. Both the VM and native code call the same C ABI, so the runtime must remain stable across releases.

### VM interpreter

The VM is a stack machine that dispatches opcodes in a `switch` loop. Each call creates a frame holding registers, an evaluation stack, and block state. Values are stored in a tagged `Slot` that represents integers, floats, pointers, and strings.

Execution model and state:

- **Frame:** local virtual-register array, stack slots for `alloca`, and an instruction pointer (block + index).
- **Heap:** managed by the runtime for strings/arrays.
- **Call stack:** vector of frames, one per IL invocation.

Core dispatch sketch:

```cpp
for (;;) {
  switch (instr.opcode) {
    case OP_ADD:
      regs[d] = regs[a] + regs[b];
      ++ip;
      break;
    case OP_CBR:
      ip = regs[cond] ? then_bb->first : else_bb->first;
      break;
    case OP_CALL:
      regs[dst] = call_runtime_or_fn(fsym, args...);
      ++ip;
      break;
    case OP_RET:
      return regs[retv];
  }
}
```

Runtime services manage heap-allocated strings with reference counting. Extern calls bridge to C helpers for I/O and string manipulation. The VM can trace execution (`--trace`, `--trace-calls`) to dump executed instructions, call/return events, and value states, aiding debugging and performance analysis. Traps surface structured diagnostics that include function, block, and source location information.

### Code generation

`src/codegen/x86_64/` contains the experimental backend. It does not yet produce runnable machine code but outlines the long-term plan to translate IL modules to SysV x86-64, reusing existing passes for optimization.

Pipeline expectations:

1. **Lowering:** optionally translate IL to a simpler MIR or operate directly.
2. **Liveness:** compute live intervals for virtual registers.
3. **Register allocation:** linear scan with spill slots on the stack.
4. **Instruction selection:** greedy mapping (e.g., `add i64` → `addq`, comparisons → `cmp` + conditional branches).
5. **Prologue/Epilogue:** establish stack frame, preserve callee-saved registers, align stack.
6. **Calling convention:** map IL calls to SysV (GP args in `rdi`..`r9`, FP in `xmm0`..).
7. **Assembly emission:** generate `.s`, assemble to `.o`, and link with `librt.a`.
8. **Debug info (optional):** comments or DWARF metadata later.

Differential testing against the VM keeps codegen honest once implemented.

### Tools & CLI

The CLI (`ilc`) dispatches to focused handlers based on the first tokens:

- `-run <file.il> [--trace] [--stdin-from <file>] [--max-steps N] [--bounds-checks]`
- `front basic -emit-il <file.bas> [--bounds-checks]`
- `front basic -run <file.bas> [--trace] [--stdin-from <file>] [--max-steps N] [--bounds-checks]`
- `il-opt <in.il> -o <out.il> --passes p1,p2`

Handlers live in `src/tools/ilc/cmd_run_il.cpp`, `cmd_front_basic.cpp`, and `cmd_il_opt.cpp`; `src/tools/ilc/main.cpp` merely dispatches to these subcommands. Additional tools (verifier, disassembler) reuse the same IL libraries.

Diagnostics carry source mapping (file/line/column) through AST → IL → VM/native for clear errors, and a REPL (`ilc repl`) is a nice-to-have backed by the VM.

### Extensibility points

- **New front end:** add a directory under `src/frontends/` and emit IL modules that honor the runtime ABI.
- **New intrinsic:** register in `src/frontends/basic/Intrinsics.cpp`, implement a runtime extern, and extend the verifier if new types are involved.
- **New IL pass:** implement in `src/il/transform/`, register with `PassManager`, and ensure verifier invariants hold.
- **Additional languages:** reuse symbol-table and type-checker utilities, desugar loops into blocks/branches, and keep the IL small and orthogonal so backends remain simple.
- **Runtime growth:** extend the C ABI in backward-compatible ways; both the VM and native backends immediately benefit.

### Deterministic naming

Deterministic label naming ensures recompiling the same source yields identical IL. Stable labels keep golden tests from drifting and make builds reproducible, so the IR builder interns symbols and assigns names deterministically.

### Performance notes

Interpreter hot spots include opcode dispatch and string routines. Constant folding and dead code elimination have the largest impact on throughput. Future improvements:

- Switch-based dispatch can evolve into direct-threaded dispatch (computed gotos).
- Intern frequent strings and cache constants.
- In the backend, add peephole rewrites, constant folding during IL build, and linear-scan register allocation with live-interval splitting.

### Compatibility & versioning

Modules declare an IL version (`il 0.1.2`) at the top. The runtime ABI aims to remain stable across versions; breaking changes require bumping the IL version and updating consumers.

### Glossary

- **AST:** tree form produced by the parser.
- **IL:** intermediate language consumed by passes and backends.
- **Block:** sequence of instructions ending in a terminator.
- **Terminator:** instruction that ends a block (`ret`, `br`, `cbr`, `trap`).
- **Extern:** IL symbol resolved to a runtime C function.
- **Verifier:** checker enforcing IL invariants.
- **Pass:** transformation over an IL module.
- **VM frame:** stack record for a function invocation.

## C++ Project Overview

### Guiding principles

- Single thin-waist IL shared by all front ends and back ends.
- Strong module boundaries: each layer builds its own library without cross-layer reach-through.
- Determinism first: the VM is the semantic oracle; native code must match it.
- Testable units: verifier, serializer, VM, and backend maintain golden/e2e coverage.
- Solo-friendly: minimal dependencies, predictable build, incremental milestones.

/scripts/            # dev scripts (format, lint, build, test)
```

Top-level CMake targets include `il_core`, `il_vm`, `il_codegen_x86_64`, `frontend_basic`, `librt`, CLI executables (`ilc`, `il-dis`, `il-verify`), and dedicated test binaries.

### Tooling & Build

- C++20 (`-std=c++20`) with `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror`.
- Sanitizers (`-fsanitize=address,undefined`) in dev/CI.
- Dependencies kept small and vendorable: `fmt`, CLI11/lyra, Catch2 or gtest.
- Formatting via `clang-format`, linting with `clang-tidy`.
- CI matrix (Linux/macOS) caches builds and runs sanitizers plus tests.

### Namespaces and libraries

- `il::core`, `il::build`, `il::io`, `il::verify` for IL infrastructure.
- `il::vm` for the interpreter engine.
- `il::codegen::x86_64` for the native backend.
- `fe::basic` for the BASIC front end.
- `rt` (C ABI) for the runtime library.

### Core IL library (C++)

#### Data model (lightweight, cache-friendly)

- `TypeKind` enum (`Void`, `I1`, `I64`, `F64`, `Ptr`, `Str`) with lightweight equality/hash.
- `Value` tagged structs (`Temp`, `ConstInt`, `ConstFloat`, `ConstStr`, `GlobalAddr`) with compact payloads.
- `Instr` stores opcode, result type, optional destination, operands (`small_vector`), and `SourceLoc`.
- IR aggregates: `BasicBlock`, `Function` (params, return type, blocks, attributes, visibility), `Global`, and `Module` (target triple, extern declarations, string literals).
- Symbol tables use interned strings to avoid duplication.

#### IRBuilder (ergonomic construction)

- Tracks current function and block to ensure well-formedness.
- Provides helpers like `const_i64`, `add`, `br`, `cbr`, and `call`.
- Guarantees exactly one terminator per block and records source metadata during lowering.

#### IL I/O (text format)

- Deterministic serializer that sorts externs/globals and assigns stable temporary numbers.
- Parser implemented with a small tokenizer and recursive-descent grammar tailored to the IL spec.
- Round-trip tests (`parse → print → parse`) ensure structural equivalence.

#### Verifier

- Structural checks: one terminator per block, labels defined/used, dominance of operands.
- Type checks: operands match opcode expectations; calls respect arity and signatures.
- Alignment rules for memory operations.
- Deliverable: `il_verify(Module&) -> std::vector<Diagnostic>`.

### Runtime library (/runtime, C, stable ABI)

- Files: `rt_print.c`, `rt_string.c`, `rt_input.c`, `rt_mem.c`, `rt_math.c`.
- Header `rt.hpp` declares console, string, math, and memory helpers.
- String representation: ref-counted heap blocks (length + capacity + UTF-8 bytes).
- Builds to static library `librt.a`, linked by both VM host shims and native outputs.

### Interpreter (`il::vm`)

#### Execution engine

- Types: `Slot` (tagged union of `uint64_t`, `double`, pointers), `Frame` (function reference, register array, stack for `alloca`, instruction cursor), and `VM` (module pointer, host function table, call stack).
- Dispatch uses a classic `switch` with optional evolution to computed gotos.
- `alloca` implemented as a bump pointer in the frame-local stack; memory ops rely on `memcpy` with runtime checks.
- Calls push new frames for IL functions or marshal arguments to C externs.

#### Tracing & diagnostics

- Flags like `--trace` and `--trace-calls` expose executed instructions and frame transitions.
- Traps propagate structured errors with location metadata, enabling pretty diagnostics at the CLI layer.

### Codegen (`il::codegen::x86_64`)

#### Pipeline

1. Lower IL to target-friendly form (optional MIR).
2. Compute liveness for virtual registers.
3. Run linear-scan register allocation with spill slot reuse.
4. Select instructions via greedy patterns.
5. Emit prologues/epilogues preserving ABI invariants.
6. Marshal calls to SysV conventions (GP and FP register assignments).
7. Output assembly (`.s`), assemble, and link with the runtime.
8. Optionally emit debug annotations (comments today, DWARF later).

## Archived blueprint highlights

### Testing strategy (solo-friendly)

- Golden tests: source → expected IL text.
- VM end-to-end tests: run IL on the interpreter, assert stdout/return codes.
- Backend end-to-end tests: compile to native and compare outputs to VM results.
- Differential testing: VM versus native outputs for each sample.
- Verifier unit tests: malformed IR cases to ensure detection.
- Lightweight fuzzing: stress lexer/parser with small random inputs.

### Extensibility for new languages

- Contract: new front ends must emit valid IL and adhere to the runtime ABI.
- BASIC specifics: keywords map to straightforward control flow and runtime calls; dynamic-leaning typing handled via coercions to the IL's small type set (`i64`, `f64`, `str`) plus runtime helpers.
- Future front ends (Tiny C, Pascal, …): reuse symbol-table utilities, keep desugaring consistent, and avoid pushing complexity into the IL.

### IL details worth nailing early

- Prefer `i64` and `f64` as canonical numeric types; use `i1` for booleans and keep strings opaque.
- Clearly define undefined behavior (e.g., division by zero triggers a runtime diagnostic).
- Verifier must enforce operand dominance, single terminators per block, type correctness, call signature adherence, and no implicit fallthrough.

### Interpreter vs. codegen division of labor

- Interpreter acts as the semantic oracle and fastest path to functionality.
- Backend focuses on performance and binary output, never redefining language behavior.
- When native execution diverges, compare to VM output to isolate codegen defects.

### Minimal code sketches

```cpp
// IR builder usage
Value v1 = b.const_i64(2);
Value v2 = b.const_i64(3);
Value sum = b.add(v1, v2);
b.call(sym("rt_print_i64"), {sum});
b.ret(b.const_i32(0));
```

```c
// Interpreter dispatch sketch
for (;;) {
    Instr *i = ip++;
    switch (i->op) {
        case OP_ADD:
            regs[i->dst] = regs[i->a].i64 + regs[i->b].i64;
            break;
        case OP_CBR:
            ip = regs[i->cond].i1 ? i->tgt : i->ftgt;
            break;
        case OP_CALL:
            regs[i->dst] = call_host(i->callee, regs, i->argc);
            break;
        case OP_RET:
            return regs[i->retv];
    }
}
```

```asm
# Assembly emission sketch (x86-64 SysV)
push %rbp
mov %rsp, %rbp
sub $32, %rsp      # spill area
# ... instructions mapped from IL ...
mov %rbp, %rsp
pop %rbp
ret
```

### Diagnostics & developer UX

- Carry source mapping through all stages for precise errors.
- Show source snippets with carets when reporting diagnostics.
- Optional VM tracing flag (`--trace-il`) prints executed IL instructions with values.
- A REPL built on the VM would improve interactive workflows.

### Performance considerations

- Interpreter: investigate computed gotos for dispatch, intern common strings, and cache constant values.
- Backend: add peephole optimizations, leverage constant folding during IL construction, and improve register allocation.

### Risks & mitigations

- Scope creep → enforce a strict v1 feature set and milestone-based roadmap.
- Type-system complexity → keep IL types minimal and push conversions to front ends/runtime helpers.
- String/heap bugs → start with ref-counted strings, add ASAN/UBSAN in CI, and build a focused test suite.
- Codegen pitfalls → lean on VM-oracle differential tests and begin with a single platform/ABI.

### Suggested roadmap

- **Milestone A (bring-up):** BASIC front end for `PRINT`, `LET`, `IF`, `GOTO`; IL core + verifier + serializer; runtime printing; VM executes small programs with golden tests.
- **Milestone B (control & funcs):** `WHILE/WEND`, `FOR/NEXT`, simple functions; runtime input (`rt_input_line`); CLI flags `-emit-il`, `-run`.
- **Milestone C (codegen v1):** x86-64 SysV codegen, linear-scan register allocation, emit `.s`, assemble/link with `librt.a`; differential tests (VM vs native).
- **Milestone D (quality):** peephole optimizer, improved diagnostics, expanded library (strings/math/file I/O); optional bytecode encoding for a faster VM.

### Definition of done for v1

- BASIC subset compiles to IL, runs correctly on the VM, and compiles to native with matching outputs.
- Clear CLI, docs, and tests accompany the implementation.
- Clean separation between front end ↔ IL ↔ VM/codegen ↔ runtime.
- Interpreter-first workflow keeps the IL as the stable contract between language and machine layers.

## ViperTUI Architecture

ViperTUI is an experimental terminal UI library built in layers. Each layer stays focused and exposes a small surface so higher tiers can be tested without a real terminal.

### Layers

#### Term

Low-level terminal handling lives under `tui/term/`. `TermIO` abstracts writes to the terminal while `TerminalSession` configures raw mode and manages alt-screen state. Clipboard support uses OSC 52 sequences but can be disabled for tests.

#### Render

`tui/render/` converts a widget tree into escape sequences. It maintains an in-memory surface and computes minimal diffs before emitting to `TermIO`.

#### UI

`tui/ui/` holds the widget tree and focus management. It delivers input events, invokes widget callbacks, and triggers re-renders when state changes.

#### Widgets

Reusable components such as lists, containers, and modals live in `tui/widgets/`. Widgets compose other widgets and render through the UI and render layers.

#### Text

`tui/text/` provides buffer management and search utilities used by widgets that edit or display text.

#### Tests

Tests exercise the layers without a real TTY by using `StringTermIO` to capture rendered output. Setting `VIPERTUI_NO_TTY=1` ensures `TerminalSession` stays inactive so tests run headless.

### Environment Flags

- `VIPERTUI_NO_TTY` – when set to `1`, `TerminalSession` skips TTY setup and the application renders a single frame then exits (useful for CI and tests).
- `VIPERTUI_DISABLE_OSC52` – disables OSC 52 clipboard sequences so tests do not emit control codes on unsupported terminals.

### Headless Testing Pattern

```cpp
using tui::term::StringTermIO;

// Force headless mode and capture output.
setenv("VIPERTUI_NO_TTY", "1", 1);
StringTermIO tio;           // acts like a fake terminal
// ... render widgets using `tio` ...
assert(tio.buffer().find("expected text") != std::string::npos);
```

`StringTermIO` records all writes and allows assertions on the exact escape sequences produced by the render layer.
