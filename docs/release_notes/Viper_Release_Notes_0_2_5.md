# Viper Compiler Platform — Release Notes

> **Development Status:** Pre-Alpha. Viper is under active development and not ready for production use.

## Version 0.2.5 — Pre-Alpha (DRAFT — unreleased)

<!-- DRAFT: release date TBD. v0.2.4 was cut on 2026-04-13. -->

### What this release is about

A polish-and-hardening cycle with several notable new capabilities.

- **Hardening across every runtime subsystem.** Integer-overflow, handle-validation, timeout-clamping, and lifetime-correctness passes applied to graphics, text, threads, audio, I/O, and network.
- **Production 2D Graphics module (new).** ~40 classes on top of `Pixels` / `Canvas` — offscreen surfaces, materials, shaders, post-effects, viewport scaling, tile layers, path drawing, text layout, nine-slice UI, animation, and a render-pass graph.
- **Full 3D asset pipeline.** glTF and FBX import real skeletons, per-vertex skinning, and animations including sparse-accessor morph deltas and the full KHR extension suite. HDR RenderTarget3D and backend-capability introspection complete the picture.
- **Network stack became a platform.** TLS-backed `HttpsServer` + `WssServer`, from-scratch HTTP/2, native RSA, in-tree X.509 validator, cookie jar, streaming downloads, and connection pooling.
- **Viper.Localization.* (new).** Eleven-class namespace for locale-aware number/date/time/list formatting, translation catalogs, CLDR plural selection, and text-direction utilities. Zero external dependencies; en-US baked in.
- **Native codegen correctness pass.** Variadic IL end-to-end, checked FP casts with distinct error kinds, sub-width overflow arithmetic, `fptosi` NaN traps, Windows ARM64 native build, and two rounds of IL optimizer/verifier hardening.
- **Structured diagnostics & developer tooling.** Source-location snippet printing with caret underlines, JSON output mode (`--diagnostic-format=json`), strict diagnostics and bounds checks on by default, `Verifier::verifyAll` multi-diagnostic collection, and `BytecodeCompiler::compileChecked` returning typed `Expected<BytecodeModule>` with verifier preflight instead of throwing.

The biggest user-visible new thing is a text-mode baseball-franchise simulator.

### Audio

- WAV / OGG / MP3 share one decoder dispatch; float32 WAV, large headers, incremental MP3, crossfade pause/resume, ADSR short-note release, and silent-channel skip all fixed.
- Sound/Music handles carry magic tags (`VSND` / `VMUS`) and validate before use; decoded sound capped at 100 MiB, sample rate at 384 kHz.
- vaud mixer: `source_channels` tracking, stream-eof/loop-pending flags, seek clamping, and voice-ID wrap recovery.
- `Music.SetLoop` is IL-bound; `Audio.Update()` drives crossfade from outside `Playlist.Update`; MusicGen rejects beats past the song span; Playlist shuffle uses `rt_rand_int`.
- **PCM allocation overflow guards** — `vaud_pcm_s16_buffer_size(frames, channels, out_bytes)` validates the full `frames × channels × sizeof(int16_t)` product against `SIZE_MAX` before allocation; `vaud_checked_resampled_frames()` rejects zero, negative, or overflow-sentinel (`INT64_MAX`) frame counts before any `malloc`. Both helpers are applied at all six resample-and-alloc sites: `vaud_load_sound`, `vaud_load_sound_mem`, `vaud_music_fill_buffer` (OGG and MP3 streaming paths), `vaud_load_music`, `vaud_load_music_ogg`, and `vaud_load_music_mp3`. `ctx->running` start/stop transitions use `__atomic_store_n` with `__ATOMIC_RELEASE` ordering.
- **WAV format expansion** — `vaud_wav.c` parser now handles 8, 24, and 32-bit integer PCM and 32-bit IEEE-754 float WAV files in addition to 16-bit; `validate_wav_format()` and `validate_wav_data_alignment()` cross-check `block_align` and `byte_rate` against derived values so malformed headers are rejected before allocation. Seek/tell helpers use `_fseeki64`/`_ftelli64` on Windows and `fseeko`/`ftello` on POSIX for correct 64-bit file offsets.
- **ALSA write loop + shutdown hang** — Linux backend replaces the bare `snd_pcm_writei()` call with `alsa_write_all()`, which handles partial writes, `-EAGAIN` retries, and `-EPIPE`/`-ESTRPIPE` underrun/suspend recovery in a loop so frames are never silently dropped. `snd_pcm_drop()` is called before `pthread_join()` in `vaud_platform_shutdown()` to abort any blocking write and prevent an indefinite hang on teardown. `vaud_set_master_volume()` sanitizes non-finite values to 0.0 and clamps out-of-range finite values. `vaud_destroy()` detaches owned sound/music handles so callers can still free them after the context is gone.
- **Audio decode edge hardening** — `vaud_resample()` rejects invalid rates/channels before division; WAV 32-bit PCM and float32 paths decode from explicit little-endian words instead of host-endian `memcpy`; MP3 music streams tolerate unknown total sample counts; streamed leftover PCM allocation now goes through the checked `vaud_pcm_s16_buffer_size()` path.

### GUI Library

Six rounds of widget audit plus an app-registry + widget-family overhaul.

- **Interactive widgets** — keyboard nav, undo/redo, multi-select (Ctrl/Shift), press-release coupling, typeahead, and desktop-convention behavior across CodeEditor, TabBar, Toolbar, Dropdown, TextInput, TreeView, ListBox, Spinner, SplitPane, FileDialog, and CommandPalette.
- **Overlay widgets** — Dialog, Tooltip, Notification, Breadcrumb, ContextMenu, and FloatingPanel rewritten with rounded-card paint, scaled metrics, fade+slide animation, and screen-bounds anchoring.
- **Layout and framework** — flex non-stretch alignment, VBox/HBox margin budgets, synthesized double-click, Tab/Shift+Tab focus traversal. Lifetime crashes closed across Tooltip, Dialog, Notification, CodeEditor, and VideoWidget.
- **App-registry refactor** — `rt_gui_app.c` gains handle-registry arrays for safe liveness queries; handle-validation pass on every public widget entry.
- **Widget tombstone/retire pattern** — TreeView nodes and ListBox items carry magic tags (`VG_TREE_NODE_MAGIC`, `VG_LISTBOX_ITEM_MAGIC`) and retire on removal; public API entries check the live predicate so handle use-after-remove becomes a silent no-op instead of heap corruption. Widget-base sentinels (`VG_WIDGET_MAGIC`), `vg_widget_is_live()`, and `rt_gui_is_widget_handle()` extend the pattern to all runtime widget handles.
- **Scroll and click precision** — Wheel events store hit-test coordinates in dedicated `wheel.screen_x/y` fields separate from scroll deltas, preventing delta corruption during coordinate localization. `WasClicked()` now reports the widget that received `VG_EVENT_CLICK` (via `vg_widget_note_click`) rather than the pointer-hit target at mouse-up.
- **Layout constraint propagation** — `layout_nonnegative()` prevents negative computed dimensions from propagating when padding exceeds container size; `layout_apply_constraints()` enforces preferred/min/max constraints uniformly across VBox, HBox, Flex, Grid, and Dock.
- **Round-3 widget hardening** — Spinner uses a dynamic `realloc`-based text buffer (was 64 bytes fixed) and rejects NaN/inf; Slider rejects NaN/inf and auto-swaps inverted range bounds; RadioButton/RadioGroup cross-reference lifecycle correctly unregisters on destroy; ColorPicker `syncing_children` reentrancy flag prevents N `on_change` firings during programmatic color set; ColorPalette paint implemented (`vgfx_fill_rect` for swatches, `vgfx_rect` for borders); Label and Checkbox initialize to theme fonts; ListBox ctrl-toggle-off correctly moves `selected` and `anchor_selected`; ScrollView `clamp_scroll` re-clamps on direction change; TextInput returns `false` for unhandled keys so focus events bubble; Dropdown fires `on_change` on item remove/clear and uses `vg_utf8_decode` for Unicode typeahead.
- **Image loading** — `vg_image_load_file()` implemented: pure-C BMP decoder (24/32bpp, top/bottom-up, overflow-safe stride math) plus macOS CoreGraphics/ImageIO for PNG/JPEG/TIFF. Zero external dependencies maintained.
- **Round-4 widget hardening** — `event_modal_safe_capture()` releases input capture when a modal root is active and the captured widget lives outside the modal subtree, applied to both mouse and keyboard dispatch. FindReplaceBar gains POSIX `<regex.h>` search (variable-length patterns, `REG_EXTENDED`/`REG_ICASE`, whole-word post-check; Windows path returns "Regex unavailable"); `regcomp`/`regexec`/`regfree`/`regerror` added to `DynamicSymbolPolicy`. MenuBar `remove_item`/`remove_menu` validate `parent_menu`/`owner_menubar` before unlinking and roll back cleanly on OOM. TextInput `ensure_capacity` bootstraps from zero; `push_undo` pre-allocates snapshot before truncating redo history; surrogate codepoints (U+D800–U+DFFF) and scalars above U+10FFFF silently rejected on character input. CodeEditor `SetText` clears stale manual highlight spans on document replacement; `SetCustomKeywords` builds the new array atomically before freeing the old one. CommandPalette, Breadcrumb, and Minimap wrappers install GC finalizers and vtable `destroy` intercepts so explicit `Destroy()` and runtime collection share the same idempotent path; all public methods null-guard the backing widget after destroy. Keyboard shortcut evaluation deferred until after modal overlays dispatch; migrated from `VGFX_MOD_*` to `VG_MOD_*` constants. `Viper.GUI.Theme` instance type corrected to `"none"` in `runtime.def` — it is a static class with no constructor.
- **TrueType font bounds validation** — `vg_ttf.c` reworked: every table read (cmap, glyf, loca, hmtx, kern, head, hhea, maxp, name) validates offset + length against the file buffer size before dereferencing; composite glyph recursion capped to prevent stack overflow on pathological fonts; glyph point-count and per-contour coordinate delta arrays bounds-checked before decode; rasterizer span-buffer `realloc` failure returns a blank glyph instead of using a stale pointer; `vg_ttf_internal.h` adds safe 16/32-bit read macros for bounded buffer access.
- **Round-5 widget hardening** — `clear_runtime_references_for_subtree()` clears global focus, input-capture, modal-root, hover, last-click, and reported-click pointers when any point into a subtree being detached; called from `vg_widget_remove_child()` and `vg_widget_clear_children()` so removing a focused or captured widget no longer leaves a dangling pointer in global state. `vg_widget_take_impl_data()` lets custom vtable destroy hooks claim ownership of `impl_data` before the base path would double-free it; `grid_destroy` and `dock_destroy` updated. `vg_widget_destroy()` now frees drag-and-drop strings (`drag_type`, `drag_data`, `accepted_drop_types`, `_drop_received_type`, `_drop_received_data`) that were previously leaked. `vg_widget_set_runtime_state()` validates each pointer with `vg_widget_is_live()` before restoring it so a stale snapshot cannot reinstall a dangling pointer. `vg_widget_get_focused()` scoped to a subtree root (NULL = global). `vg_widget_insert_child()` with a negative index clamps to 0 instead of silently dropping the child. Dynamic `focus_list_t` replaces the fixed 512-entry stack array in `build_tab_order()` / `collect_focusable()`; trees with more than 512 focusable items now navigate correctly. `vg_event.c` resize translation prefers `logical_width`/`logical_height` (populated by HiDPI backends) over physical dimensions when available.
- **Round-6 low-level correctness** — normal widget painting now supplies screen-space coordinates while preserving layout-space state; Grid clamps negative placements and commits row/column count changes only after track-array allocation succeeds; UTF-8 decoding rejects overlong, surrogate, and out-of-range scalar values, with TextInput prefix scans bounded by the caller's byte limit. CodeEditor edit paths clamp stale cursor/history positions, guard growth math, and check `get_text()` size accumulation; Image opacity sanitizes non-finite values.

### Graphics runtime (2D)

- `RT_CANVAS_MAGIC` guard on every public entry; `CopyRect` / `Screenshot` carry `Pixels` return types through IL; shared HiDPI helpers and explicit-alpha blend flag.
- **Production 2D Graphics module (new)** — ~40 CPU-backed classes: core rendering (RenderTarget2D, Texture2D, Renderer2D, Material2D, Shader2D, PostProcess2D), tiles (TileSet2D, TileLayer2D, AutoTile2D, TilemapRenderer2D), animation (AnimationClip2D, AnimatedSprite2D, CameraRig2D), vector/text/UI (Path2D, ShapeRenderer2D, TextRenderer2D, NineSlice2D, DebugDraw2D), viewport (Viewport2D, Transform2D), and import adapters (TexturePackerAtlas, AsepriteImporter, TiledMapLoader).
- Overflow hardening across pixel/tile allocation, PNG/BMP stride math, blit/draw coordinates, flood-fill, and `Pixels.BlendPixel` compositing.

### Graphics3D

- **Asset import** — glTF: full attribute coverage, real skin + animation (LINEAR/STEP/CUBICSPLINE with Hermite tangents), sparse accessors, `extensionsRequired`, KHR_texture_transform / emissive_strength / unlit / lights_punctual. FBX: scene-node hierarchy, per-vertex skinning, cross-platform texture paths, AnimationStack names.
- **Per-instance morphs** — `Model3D.Instantiate` deep-clones morph meshes so animating one instance doesn't bleed into clones; per-shape tangent deltas added.
- **Material3D** — 6 texture slots each with independent wrap/filter/UV-set/UV-transform; TEXCOORD_1 added end-to-end across all four backends.
- **Canvas3D / backends** — `BackendCapabilities` / `BackendSupports` introspection; deterministic shadow-light selection; PCF shadows + sRGB decode in SW rasterizer; HDR `RenderTarget3D.NewHdr`; ordered GPU postfx chain; dynamic-light cap 8→16; bone limit 128→256.
- **Physics3D** — bodies/contacts/joints grow on demand (overflow-safe doubling); broadphase moves toward O(N log N); CCD substeps 8→64.
- NaN/inf sanitization across Camera3D / Light3D / PostFX3D setters; `Scene3D` threads an inherited animator down child nodes.

### Game runtime

- **Dialogue** rewritten against the real BitmapFont measurement surface; UTF-8 codepoint boundaries for wrap and reveal.
- **Viper.Game hardening** — Entity sweeps tile collisions preserving centipixel remainders; Pathfinder rejects oversized grids; Physics2D exposes `CircleBody` and per-step contacts.
- Correctness fixes across Quadtree, Physics2D, PathFollower, SpriteAnimation, SceneManager, ParticleEmitter, Achievement, and ButtonGroup.
- **Input** — action chord releases on last-key-drop frame; debounced press-edge detection; real UTF-8 encoding up to U+10FFFF.
- **Async UAF fix** — `Async.Run` / `Thread.Start` worker VMs retain the Future payload past worker unwind; pinned by a 25× regression loop.
- `Config.Load` pre-checks file existence and returns NULL for missing configs (documented soft-fail).
- **RNG debiasing** — `rt_random_bounded_u64()` uses rejection sampling to eliminate modulo bias; `rt_rand_int` and `rt_rand_range` now produce statistically uniform results across all bound sizes.

### Collections runtime

- All string-keyed collection types (Map, MultiMap, CountMap, LruCache, TreeMap, FrozenMap, FrozenSet, SortedSet, WeakMap) compare full byte-length keys; embedded NULs no longer truncate identity.
- Ownership fixes across Seq, Deque, List, MultiMap, SparseArray, OrderedMap, and TreeMap — retained values released on overwrite, removal, clear, eviction, and finalization.
- Bytes, BinaryBuffer, Trie, and BiMap use runtime byte lengths for binary payloads; embedded NULs no longer truncate parsing or lookups.
- Snapshot APIs tightened: Trie/SortedSet sequences own copied strings; IntMap/SparseArray return boxed `i64`; Stack iterates bottom-to-top without mutating the source.
- Allocation failure traps cleanly across Bag, MultiMap, LruCache, Deque, UnionFind, FrozenMap, FrozenSet, SparseArray, and BloomFilter.
- WeakMap stores zeroing handles; `Length` / `Has` / `Keys` report live values; `Compact` removes stale slots.
- Overflow hardening across growth paths, capacity counters, hash-table resize, BloomFilter sizing, Bytes base64 sizing, and BinaryBuffer length-prefix writes.

### IO runtime

- File replacement paths (`WriteAllText`, `WriteAllBytes`, `Archive.Finish/Extract`, `SaveData.Save`) write temp sidecars and atomically replace the destination; failed writes clean up instead of leaving partial files.
- Archive: `Create` no longer truncates before `Finish`; ZIP entries validate CRCs, size agreement, and data bounds; parser rejects embedded-NUL names, corrupt offsets, and symlink traversal.
- File paths reject embedded NULs; `File.Size` requires regular files; `File.Copy` enforces no-overwrite; `Move` preserves replace semantics.
- Stream wrappers retain the wrapped object for the wrapper lifetime; closed/null streams trap on all operations except `Close(NULL)`.
- `Dir.RemoveAll` handles top-level symlinks without recursion; `Dir.Files` excludes symlinks on POSIX; `Dir.MakeAll` accepts backslash on POSIX.
- GZIP rejects reserved flags, malformed optional headers, bad FHCRC, CRC/size mismatches; raw DEFLATE rejects trailing data after the final block.
- `SaveData.Load` treats a missing file as empty-success; malformed JSON preserves prior state intact.

### Localization runtime (new)

Eleven-class `Viper.Localization.*` namespace. Zero external dependencies; en-US baked as a static record, all other locales load from JSON at runtime.

- **Locale / LocaleInfo / LocaleManager** — BCP-47 parser with case-canonicalization, fallback-chain walk, rwlock-guarded process-global registry, system-locale detection on all three platforms. No Foundation.framework on macOS.
- **NumberFormat** — Decimal/Integer/Percent/Currency/Scientific/Ordinal format + parse with six rounding modes; strict/lenient group-placement validation; `TryParse*` returns Optional.
- **DateFormat** — CLDR pattern letters, locale-digit emission (Arabic-Indic / Devanagari / Thai / etc.), canonical Short/Medium/Long/Full/DateTime methods.
- **RelativeTimeFormat / MessageBundle / PluralRules** — auto unit selection across 7 thresholds, named/positional placeholders, CLDR cardinal + ordinal rules on a compact AST; INT64_MIN precision fix via `i_d` double operand.
- **Collator / ListFormat / TextDirection** — DUCET-lite weights with sv-SE tailoring, locale-template list joining, strong-RTL classifier for Hebrew/Arabic/Syriac/Thaana/N'Ko.
- Refcount + lifetime discipline: all finalizers route through `rt_obj_release_check0 → rt_obj_free`; `LocaleManager.Unload` uses atomic reads; lazy-init CAS uses `__atomic_compare_exchange_n` on GCC/Clang, `rt_atomic_compare_exchange_ptr` on MSVC.

### Core runtime formatting

- `rt_fmt` locale-aware rewrite — float/currency/percent route through a C-locale isolated `snprintf` (`uselocale` on POSIX, `_create_locale` on Windows) so numeric output is deterministic regardless of process `setlocale` state.
- Float formatter standardized to `%.15g`; `rt_fmt_bool_yn` lowercase (`"yes"` / `"no"`); BASIC `VAL` permissive parse restored (`strtod` + trailing-garbage tolerance); `rt_parse` integer/double parsers tightened.

### Time runtime

- Overflow-checked arithmetic across all modules (DateTime, DateOnly, DateRange, Duration, RelTime, Stopwatch, Countdown) via shared `dt_checked_*` helpers; all paths trap via `rt_trap_ovf` instead of wrapping.
- `DateTime.Create` range-checks components before `mktime`; formatters validate `int64_t → time_t` before `localtime`/`gmtime`.
- `Duration.Abs(INT64_MIN)` and `Neg(INT64_MIN)` now trap; `snprintf` length validation on every string producer.
- Countdown sleeps long waits in chunks; Stopwatch uses checked scale/add math for ns/us/ms conversions.

### Text runtime

- Overflow + validation hardening: JSON streaming adds a per-depth state machine; regex caps internal offsets at `INT_MAX`; StringBuilder, TOML, CSV, Scanner, Template, Codec, GUID, numfmt all got length/depth/byte-count guards.
- `Version.Parse` is strict SemVer 2.0.0; `JsonStream` value accessors (`BoolValue`, `NumberValue`, `StringValue`, `HasNext`, `Skip`) let consumers extract values without re-parsing.
- `TextWrapper.WrapLines` and `Template.Keys` return `Seq<String>`; `rtgen` understands `seq<T>` / `list<T>` return types.

### Threads runtime

- Timeout/deadline math clamps rather than wraps everywhere (Future, Monitor, Channel, ThreadPool, Scheduler, Debounce, ConcQueue, ConcMap) — fixes a ~49-day Win32 hang from sign-extending a negative `int64` to `DWORD`.
- Parallel execution: cross-platform `failed` flag, `setjmp` worker-trap recovery that cleans up the whole block.
- Thread/SafeThread handles carry `VTRD` / `VTSF` magic tags; Gate/Barrier/RwLock gain `closing` + `cancelled` flags with a `can_delete` handshake eliminating unblock-and-delete races.
- `RuntimeBridge::interceptTrap` catches VM traps in async trampolines and surfaces them as Future errors.

### Network

- **TLS-backed servers (new)** — `HttpsServer` + `WssServer` with EC/RSA cert loading, SNI validation, ALPN (h2/http1.1), per-connection send-timeout.
- **HTTP/2 transport (new)** — in-tree HPACK + static Huffman; HTTPS client pools connections; ALPN multi-token bugfix; `HttpReq.SetForceHttp1` knob.
- **HTTP client** — RFC cookie jar, transparent gzip, streaming download, relative-Location resolution, keep-alive + connection pooling, CRLF injection guards.
- **HTTP server** — chunked request bodies, Connection-header-aware framing, thread-safe Start/Stop, ephemeral port via `port=0`.
- **TLS / Crypto** — native RSA (Montgomery ladder, RSA-PSS-SHA256), in-tree X.509 chain validator with EKU (drops `Security.framework`), in-tree `timegm`, PBKDF2 iterations 100K→300K. P-384 ECDSA (`0x0503`) removed from ClientHello signature-algorithm extensions and from `tls_verify_cert_verify` — it was advertised but never implemented, creating a silent verification gap.
- WebSocket subprotocol negotiation, SSE auto-reconnect with `Last-Event-ID`, dual-stack IPv6 UDP, SMTP follow-ups.

### BASIC frontend

- `SemanticAnalyzer::Type::ArrayObject` — distinct type for `DIM arr(N) AS ClassName`; all dispatch paths (LBOUND/UBOUND, FOR EACH, array-assignment, completion) handle it.
- `MethodCallExpr` visitor rewritten: validates runtime class methods via typed `scoreArgMatch` lookup (exact/widening/unknown); case-insensitive OopIndex fallback for mixed-case class registrations.
- `mustReturn` rewritten as data-flow: `ReturnFlow {alwaysReturns, assignedAfter}` propagated through IF/SELECT/TRY/CATCH/FINALLY/loops; partial branches rejected; top-level `RETURN` without GOSUB emits B1008.
- Loop checks: EXIT SUB/FUNCTION validated against procedure kind; FOR counter/start/end/step type-checked as numeric; FOR EACH element type inferred from array kind.
- FINALLY bodies analyzed under surrounding scope; USING initializer type-checked against object/resource; `TryCatchStmt` added to `STMT_KIND_TRAIT`.
- `rt_map_get_opt_str` (new) — returns NULL for missing keys; used by the `Map.get()` optional-String path.
- `Viper.System.String`-typed variables now lower to `Type::Str` instead of `Type::Ptr`, fixing store/load type mismatches in string-variable slots.
- `SourceManager::setSource()` called after file registration so line-snippet printing works without on-disk reads; IL verifier runs post-lowering with failures surfaced through the BASIC emitter at code `B9001`.
- `lowerUsingStmt` rewritten with an `EhEntry` handler block: the exception path calls `DESTROY`, `__dtor`, and `rt_obj_free` before executing `resume.same(tok)` to re-raise the original error token. Previously, USING cleanup only ran on the normal exit path.
- `analyzeClassDecl` now walks constructor, destructor, and method bodies under proper scope context (`activeClassQName_`, `activeMemberHasMe_`, loop-context flags), closing a gap where class member bodies were analyzed without their class-member scope.
- `analyzeMemberAssignment` validates instance-field assignments with typed diagnostics B2001 (type mismatch) and B2002 (missing member); `Bool := Int` implicit widening accepted without error.
- `widen_to` (B9002), `intType` (B9003), and `lowerNumericDispatch` (B9005) now emit structured diagnostics instead of calling `std::abort()`.

### Zia frontend

- Path-aware completion: `CompleteForFile`, `CheckForFile`, `HoverForFile`, `SymbolsForFile`; relative `bind` paths resolve against the active file.
- **Parser** — `isExpressionStart()` predicate; `parseExpressionAllowingStructLiterals()` fixes struct-literal parse in bodies/initializers/returns; `clonePureExpr()` covers all AST node kinds; trailing-comma support; match arms accept semicolons.
- **Sema — types** — `Map.get` returns `Optional<V>`; `list.first/last/isEmpty` wired; postfix-try (`?`) validated; collection literal element-type checking; `finalFields_` writable only during `init()`.
- **Sema — generics + statics** — `inferTypeParamsFromPattern` does full structural inference; multi-type-arg generics parsed; `staticFields_` set with private-visibility propagation.
- **Sema — flow narrowing** — `narrowingKeyForExpr` builds dotted keys (`"self.child"`); null-check narrowing works on field access paths across if-stmt, block, and binary-op analysis.
- **Sema — async** — `types::futureOf(payload)` carries payload as `typeArgs[0]`; `AwaitExpr` reads `typeArgs[0]` directly for typed Future variables.
- **Lowerer** — range `.rev()` / `.step(n)` chains; `widenIntegralToI64` on all index paths; `lowerStructLiteral` typed field defaults; `AddressOf` forward-ref fix; Map subscript traps on absent key; all integer ops emit overflow-checking opcodes unconditionally.
- EH typed-catch rethrow: `eh.entry` + `resume.same(tok)` preserves original error token instead of synthesizing a new trap.
- **VM string cache async race fix** — `initStringCache` pre-allocates null slots; `getStringLiteral` materializes on first access, closing concurrent-init window in async worker VMs.
- **Inline aggregate lowering fix** — `emitFieldLoad` / `emitFieldStore` and class/struct field-layout now treat `Struct`, `Tuple`, and `FixedArray` uniformly as inline aggregates; previously only `FixedArray` was handled inline while struct/tuple fields were scalar-loaded from their first bytes, corrupting data silently. New `emitInlineValueStore` / `emitInlineValueCopy` helpers recurse through nested members and elements with per-element stride, string retain/release, and init-vs-overwrite semantics. Field layout delegates to `getSemanticTypeSize` / `getSemanticTypeAlignment` for all aggregate kinds.
- `getOrCreateStructTypeInfo` gains an unqualified suffix-match fallback so short names (`Pair`) resolve to `Module.Pair` without requiring full qualification at the call site.
- Safety-critical warnings (`W008` missing-return, `W010` division-by-zero, `W015` uninitialized-variable, `W016` optional-without-check, `W019` non-exhaustive-match) are promoted to errors by default; `--no-strict-diagnostics` keeps them as warnings without requiring `-Werror`.
- Zia lexer and semantic diagnostics now use stable `V-ZIA-*` codes for common failures, including unterminated block comments, unterminated strings, undefined identifiers, type mismatches, and fixed-array literal index bounds errors. Nine new entries in `scripts/spec/diagnostics.yaml`.
- `nameTemp(id, name)` attaches source-level variable names to SSA temporaries at definition time; `defineLocal()` and `createSlot()` call it so IR dumps show readable names (e.g., `%player.x`) instead of anonymous `%42` temporaries.
- `SourceManager::setSource()` called after file registration; file-ID overflow now emits a `V-SRC-FILE-ID` diagnostic and returns early; optimizer pipeline failures emit `V-OPT-PIPELINE`; `Verifier::verify` runs post-optimizer.

### Linker, codegen, tools, IL, build

- Linker: Itanium-ABI symbol classification on macOS with `$DARWIN_EXTSN`; `link()` / `strnlen()` / `pthread_mutex_trylock` added to dynamic-import allowlist. macOS ImageIO imports (`CGImageSource*`, `CGImageDestination*`, `CGImageMetadata*`, and `kCGImageProperty*`) now bind to `ImageIO.framework` before the generic CoreGraphics `CG*` rule, fixing native-linked GUI apps that load PNG/JPEG/TIFF images.
- Codegen: `RtComponent::Localization` enum entry with `rt_locale_*` prefix classifier; `viper_rt_localization` archive in install manifest.
- IL surface: `Canvas.CopyRect` / `Screenshot` return `Pixels`; `AudioUpdate` added; eleven new `RTCLS_Loc*` RuntimeTypeId entries; `RelativeTime.FormatShort` binding corrected; `AsyncSocket.ConnectForAsync` classified in the signature registry (`rt_async_connect_for`, `"obj(str,i64,i64)"`) so the optimizer no longer treats it as a full-barrier call.
- rtgen audit passes with zero findings after classifying 30 previously unclassified symbols.
- Tools: frontend `--` separator, collision-safe temp paths. Build: VERSION `0.2.4-dev` → `0.2.5-snapshot`.
- **Diagnostic infrastructure** — `Diagnostic` gains `SourceRange range` and `std::vector<DiagnosticNote> notes` fields; `diag_expected.cpp` adds source-snippet printing with caret/tilde underlines (`printSourceSnippet`) and a JSON formatter (`printDiagJson` / `printDiagnosticsJson`). `SourceManager::setSource()` populates line caches from in-memory strings without on-disk reads. `SourceManager::addFile()` no longer emits its own diagnostic on overflow — callers own that report.
- **CLI flags** — `--diagnostic-format=text|json` (also `--diagnostic-format json`), `--strict-diagnostics` / `--no-strict-diagnostics`, `--bounds-checks` / `--no-bounds-checks`, and `--show-warnings` / `--quiet-warnings` are available across subcommands; strict diagnostics and bounds checks default on. All diagnostic output routes through `printDiagnostic(format)` for consistent text-or-JSON rendering.
- **BytecodeCompiler** — `compileChecked(module, sourceManager?, assumeVerified=false)` returns `Expected<BytecodeModule>` with a source-located `Diag`; it runs verifier preflight unless the caller explicitly passes `assumeVerified=true`. Internal errors propagate via private `BytecodeCompileFailure` so no undecorated `runtime_error` escapes. Function name, block label, and source location tracked throughout for precise diagnostic attribution (e.g., `V-BC-UNKNOWN-GLOBAL`, `V-BC-UNKNOWN-SSA`, `V-BC-FUNCTION-TABLE`).
- **BytecodeVM** — trap messages enriched to `"Trap @func:block#pc file.zia:line (TrapKindName)"`.
- **Signature Registry** — `register_signature` is mutex-guarded and idempotent: identical re-registration is a no-op; conflicting metadata for the same name throws `std::logic_error`. `registry_version()` added for cache-invalidation consumers.
- `vm_executor`: `compileChecked` integration; `VMExecutorResult::compileFailed` flag; `VMExecutorConfig::sourceManager` for diagnostic context. Pipeline subcommands report all `Verifier::verifyAll` diagnostics at the appropriate stage.

### Linker hardening

All four object-file readers and all three writers received a bounds-checking and correctness pass.

- **Readers** — every reader uses `checkedRange` before buffer access; ELF validates all section/symbol/reloc ranges; COFF validates symbol-table and string-pool bounds on every long-name lookup; Mach-O preserves `__compact_unwind`/`__eh_frame`; Archive validates member/symbol/string ranges.
- **COFF addend decode** — `extractCoffAddend` decodes ARM64 instruction bit-fields (`Branch26/19`, `PageRel21`, `PageOff12A/L`, `ADDR64`) instead of a blind 4-byte read; AMD64 handles 8-byte ADDR64 correctly.
- **ELF reader (pass 2)** — extended section counts from SH0 when `e_shnum == 0`; COMMON → BSS; SHN_ABS absolute values; `.rel` implicit-addend sections; truncated-table detection.
- **COFF reader (pass 2)** — weak external fallback records; associative COMDAT relationships; relocation overflow records; BigObj rejected with a diagnostic.
- **Writers** — COFF section flags and storage class derived precisely from section kind; ELF `sh_flags` and symbol bind/visibility from linkage model; Mach-O `appendSection` for multi-text; anonymous symbols get synthesized names.
- **IL ModuleLinker** — `FunctionRef` export index; `rewriteFunctionRefs` rewrites callee names and GlobalAddr/brArgs across module boundaries; scoped global-name collision rewriting.
- **Infrastructure** — RelocApplier bounds-checks every application; BranchTrampoline reuse keyed by address; DeadStripPass keeps EH personality/LSDA roots; ICF off-by-one fix; `PT_LOAD` alignment 0x1000.

### Codegen

**AArch64**
- RegAllocPass wraps the coalesce + allocate pipeline in try/catch; exceptions become a `V-CG-AARCH64-REGALLOC` diagnostic rather than a crash.
- Peephole `buildPredecessorMap` rewritten to record both conditional-branch targets and fallthrough successor edges; previously missing fallthrough entries caused incorrect single-predecessor detection at boolean-join blocks, silently miscompiling short-circuit boolean expressions.
- **LoopOpt dominator guard** — `hoistLoopConstants()` now computes a full iterative dominator set before identifying loop back-edges. Layout-created backward edges (if/else join block placed before one predecessor) are excluded: only a block that dominates its latch is treated as a real loop header, preventing incorrect constant hoisting across branches.
- Target-platform flags (`--target-darwin/linux/windows`) thread through object-writer, native linker, and assembler target triple.
- `switch.i32` edge arguments route through dedicated edge blocks; larger tables lower as balanced binary decision trees.
- Trap ABI: `idx.chk` → `rt_trap_raise_error`; checked div/rem → `rt_trap_div0` / `rt_trap_ovf`; `trap.from_err` marshals error code into `x0`.
- Checked FP casts lower as `FRintN` + NaN/range guards with distinct `InvalidCast` vs `Overflow` errors; `fptosi` traps NaN and signed overflow; FP compare predicates match IEEE NaN semantics.
- Logical-immediate bitwise: `AndRI`, `OrrRI`, `EorRI` with correct ARM64 encoding. BTI/PAC/compact-unwind gated to Darwin. Unsigned division → `UmulhRRR` magic-multiply.
- **Windows ARM64** — `IMAGE_REL_ARM64_*` COFF relocation constants; section-relative reloc via instruction bit-field decode; MSVC runtime/SEH helper stubs; `ExitProcess` startup import; dynamic import wiring. Build scripts (`build_demos.cmd`, `CMakeLists.txt`) default to host architecture; `--arch` / `VIPER_DEMO_ARCH` override. Portability pass covers 64-bit atomic CAS, Win32 threading timeout, TLS chain, D3D11 enumeration, LC_NUMERIC isolation, and VM bridge alignment.

**x86_64**
- `MOVZXrr8` and `MOVZXrr32` are now distinct MIR opcodes with correct per-form binary encoding.
- `select` lowers through explicit MIR pseudos; large displacements materialized; invalid `alloca` sizes rejected; compare-branch folding preserves live materialized booleans.
- `fptosi` NaN + overflow checks before `CVTTSD2SI`; `sdiv.chk0` traps `INT64_MIN / -1`; incoming `i1` parameters normalized at entry.
- Sub-width checked narrowing preserves annotated result width; Win64 shadow space reserved even for call-free functions.
- `ErrGetMsg` → `rt_throw_msg_get`; `idx.chk` → `rt_trap_raise_error`; unknown opcodes are hard emitter errors.
- `conditionSuffix` and `condCodeFor` throw `std::runtime_error` instead of asserting on unrecognised condition codes.

**IL and VM**
- Variadic functions: `Function::isVarArg`, `...` syntax parsed/serialized/verified; `>= paramCount` arity enforced for variadic callees.
- `err.get_*` min operand count relaxed to 0 for context-implicit native EH lowering.
- **BytecodeVM global variables** — `LOAD_GLOBAL_ADDR` opcode (`0x2B`); `registerGlobals()` compiles IL `Global` declarations at module-load time with typed initializers for I64/F64/Str; string globals initialized via `rt_string_from_bytes`; per-slot ownership tracking (`globalsStringOwned_`) with `clearGlobalStringOwnershipForRawStore()` called on every store path to prevent double-release.
- `VMInit` throws `std::runtime_error` on bad state instead of calling `std::abort()`.
- `OpHandlers_Memory`: `minimumAlignmentFor` returns 0 for unknown memory kinds; `handleLoadImpl` / `handleStoreImpl` detect alignment 0 and dispatch `RuntimeBridge::trap(InvalidOperation)` instead of asserting.
- `Marshal::toI64` / `toF64` call `RuntimeBridge::trap(InvalidOperation)` on type mismatch rather than `std::abort()`.
- `NetworkRuntime` and `ThreadsRuntime` now catch `RuntimeTrapSignal` explicitly before the generic `std::exception` handler so trap payloads are preserved unmodified.
- IL `PassManager`: `verifyEach` diagnostics always write to `std::cerr` unconditionally; the NDEBUG guard has been removed.
- `Mem2Reg::addIncoming` logs to `std::cerr` on unexpected state instead of asserting.
- Codegen `PassManager` wraps each pass in try/catch; uncaught exceptions become a `V-CG-PASS-EXCEPTION` diagnostic.

**IL verifier hardening**
- Duplicate SSA ID detection across params, block params, and results; dominance violations are now hard errors.
- Branch args: unknown temps → "unknown branch arg"; void args → "void branch arg". Stack-escape through GEP chains and block-param edges detected via fixpoint.
- `VerifyStrategy::IntegerBinary` enables sub-word overflow arithmetic (I16/I32); `And`/`Or`/`Xor`/`Shl`/`LShr`/`AShr` added to verifier table.
- `BranchVerifier` emits "unknown branch condition" / "unknown switch.i32 scrutinee" for missing operand temps; `InstrParser` detects trailing characters after result type annotation.
- `OperandParser` resolves call return types from externs, functions, and the runtime signature registry.
- `Verifier::verifyAll(module, maxDiagnostics=50)` collects all violations with deduplication by (severity + code + message + loc) and collapses them into a primary `Diag` with attached `DiagnosticNote` entries; `verify()` now delegates to it rather than stopping at the first error.
- Alloca escape detection: the verifier now rejects alloca pointers stored into non-stack destinations or loaded through escaping GEP chains; two new golden IL fixtures (`alloca_load_escape.il`, `alloca_store_escape.il`) lock in the expected diagnostics.
- `EffectFacts` + `directCalleeEffects` query `RuntimeSignatures`, `HelperEffects`, and `FunctionAttrs` in priority order for per-call-site effect classification.
- Diagnostic codes normalized to `V-IL-WARN` / `V-IL-VERIFY` across all sub-verifiers.

**IL optimizer hardening**
- `CallEffects` priority: registry + function-declaration attrs are authoritative over instruction `CallAttr`; `canEliminateIfUnused` requires both `pure` and `nothrow`.
- `LoadSafety.hpp` — `isLoadKnownNonTrapping` gates dead-load elimination, GVN, and LICM hoisting on pointer provenance.
- `Mem2Reg` SROA offset arithmetic overflow-safe; field iteration order deterministic. `Peephole` brArgs use-counts correct; operand-forwarding scoped to intra-block only.
- `isTerminated(Block&)` replaces stale `BasicBlock::terminated` flag reads across six passes (LICM, CheckOpt, Inline, SiblingRecursion, IndVarSimplify, LoopUnroll).
- DSE / MemorySSA `fullyOverwrites()` requires MustAlias + size coverage; `getAllocaId` walks GEP chains to close pointer-derived escape gap.
- LICM hoists loads through GEP-derived alloca addresses; call classification runs before generic side-effect check.
- LoopRotate: `unordered_map<unsigned,Value>` remap so constants survive cloning; `brArgs` remapped inside `cloneInstr`; latch arity guard.
- LoopUnroll: `checkedAdd()` prevents IV overflow; `isSafeToCloneForFullUnroll()` rejects memory/call/alloca in body.
- IndVarSimplify: `long long` step, `LLONG_MIN` guard. FAdd/FMul removed from `isCommutativeCSE`.
- `ForwardingElimination`: asserts replaced with guarded early returns for fuzz safety.
- DCE alloca elimination wrapped in a do-while fixed-point loop; eliminating one dead store can reveal a second dead alloca that was previously blocked.
- MemorySSA cross-block dead-store analysis rewritten from a BFS-with-`goto` to a recursive memoized DFS with a `visiting` sentinel; back-edges in live loops now correctly return false instead of being treated as killed paths.
- SCCP calls `SimplifyCFG` post-propagation to prune unreachable blocks created by constant-folded terminators.
- `Mem2Reg` SROA pre-reserves `candidates` and `owner` maps to the alloca count before candidate collection, reducing rehashing in large functions.
- `BasicAA::queryRuntimeEffect` now consults `findRuntimeSignature` (O(1)) first, then `all_signatures()` linear scan, then `classifyHelperEffects`; removes stale size-tracking rebuild cache that could diverge from `registry_version`.

### Platform input

- macOS: bare arrow keys no longer map to PageUp/Down/Home/End; mouse-wheel delta preserved across coordinate localization.
- Linux: X11 UTF-8 text input delivers every codepoint; clipboard implemented for editor widgets.
- **ViperGFX draw overflow hardening** — `get_effective_clip_bounds()` (int64, unified) replaces four copies of an inline clip-intersection pattern; `clip_line_to_bounds()` is a Cohen-Sutherland line clipper that pre-clips endpoints before Bresenham, preventing signed-overflow in the error accumulator for lines with extreme off-screen coordinates; Bresenham's `dx`/`dy`/`err`/`e2` widened from int32 to int64; `vgfx_draw_fill_rect` computes clip intersection in int64 then narrows to int32 for scanline indices; `vgfx_set_clip` normalises zero/negative dimensions to an empty clip rect and clamps extents to the window boundary; `framebuffer_size_bytes()` validates `width × height × 4` against `SIZE_MAX`; `vgfx_create_window` guards HiDPI-scaled dimensions against `VGFX_MAX_WIDTH`/`VGFX_MAX_HEIGHT` before allocating; Linux XDND URI list parsing enforces a byte-length bound.
- **ViperGFX event queue and platform fixes** — event ring buffer protected by an `atomic_flag` spinlock (`event_lock`) replacing the SPSC-only assumption; platform callbacks that race (resize, close, mouse) are now safe. New public APIs: `vgfx_flush_events()` (discard + count), `vgfx_frame_time_ms()`, `vgfx_set_default_fps()` / `vgfx_get_default_fps()`, `vgfx_last_error_code()`; `vgfx_clear_events()` becomes a compatibility wrapper. `next_frame_deadline_ms` switched from `int64_t` to `double` and seeded immediately on `vgfx_set_fps()` so the first frame already respects the interval. `vgfx_cls()` fills the active clip rectangle instead of the whole framebuffer. Linux X11: BackSpace, Delete, Tab, Home/End, PageUp/Down, and all KP_ aliases added to `translate_keysym()`; unsigned button values sign-guarded before array index; pixel-blit loop widened from `int` to `size_t`; `prevent_close` now only suppresses `close_requested` — the CLOSE event is still enqueued. macOS: `mach_absolute_time()` conversion done in double-precision to prevent intermediate overflow on long uptimes; button sign guard applied.
- **Framebuffer and Win32 input correctness** — `vgfx_cls()` and Linux X11 presentation now write/swizzle RGBA byte-wise instead of relying on `uint32_t*` aliasing and little-endian packing. Win32 maps Backspace, Delete, Tab, Home/End, and PageUp/PageDown into the public `VGFX_KEY_*` codes and guards a failed primary-monitor `GetDC()` during DPI detection.

- Boolean short-circuit goldens (`boolean_andalso` / `boolean_orelse`) for BASIC-to-IL and IL suites; 3D character FBX assets (Knight + RPG Characters packs) for skin/animation regression; 4 IL source benchmarks (`fib_stress`, `inline_stress`, `redundant_stress`, `udiv_stress`) replace compiled binaries.
- New `test_bytecode_compiler_diagnostics.cpp`: `compileChecked` surfaces coded failures (`V-BC-UNKNOWN-GLOBAL`, function-table overflow) with source locations; new `test_vm_executor_compile_diagnostics.cpp` covers the executor compile-fail path.
- New `test_il_verify_all.cpp`: `verifyAll` deduplication and note attachment across multiple violations; new `DiagnosticCliTests.cmake` e2e test for `--diagnostic-format` flag.
- New Zia test `FixedArrayOfStructsUsesInlineElementStride` for the inline aggregate fix; verifier golden fixtures for alloca-load and alloca-store escape; extended `MemorySSATests` (cycle-safe DFS case) and `test_SignaturesPurity` (idempotent registry).
- New `test_vm_init_diagnostics.cpp`: VMInit error raises a typed exception rather than aborting. New `TlsSignaturePolicyTest.cmake`: asserts 0x0503 is absent from ClientHello extensions. `NoAssertFalseTest.cmake` scope widened to subdirectories. 3D baseball smoke probe re-enabled in `CMakeLists.txt`. BASIC sema class-member body tests added. `ThrowingPassBecomesDiagnostic` codegen pass-manager test added.
