## Version 0.2.4 - Pre-Alpha (TBD) — DRAFT

### Release Overview

Version 0.2.4 is a game engine, asset system, rendering, codegen, language features, media codecs, documentation, and showcase release. Highlights:

- **3D Engine Enhancements** — Procedural terrain generation (`Terrain3D.GeneratePerlin`), terrain LOD with frustum culling and multi-resolution chunks, Gerstner wave water simulation (`Water3D.AddWave`), new `Vegetation3D` instanced grass/foliage system with wind animation, and material shader hooks (`SetShadingModel` for Toon/Fresnel/Emissive effects).
- **3D Format Loaders** — From-scratch glTF 2.0 (.gltf/.glb), STL (binary + ASCII), OBJ .mtl material parser, FBX texture and morph target extraction. Scene3D.Save for JSON serialization.
- **Video Playback** — MJPEG/AVI video decoder with `VideoPlayer` runtime class (Open/Play/Pause/Stop/Seek/Update), MJPEG DHT injection for AVI compatibility, AVI RIFF container parser, Theora codec infrastructure (header parsing, YCbCr 4:2:0→RGB conversion, OGG multi-stream demux), GUI `VideoWidget` for Viper.GUI applications, and Image widget paint fix for the GUI library.
- **Metal Backend: macOS 26 Compatibility** — Offscreen texture readback replaces CAMetalLayer direct presentation for macOS Tahoe compatibility. Backend vtable extended with `show/hide_gpu_layer` function pointers to fix software backend crash from duplicate global symbols.
- **Media Codec Suite** — From-scratch implementations of JPEG, GIF (animated), OGG Vorbis, and MP3 decoders. Extended PNG decoder to all color types, bit depths, interlacing, and transparency. Extended WAV loader to 24-bit and float32 PCM. Added OGG/MP3 music streaming with on-the-fly resampling. Added `Pixels.Load()` auto-detect, JPEG EXIF orientation, fast FFT-based IMDCT for Vorbis, and multi-pass residue decoding. 16 new runtime source files, 8 new tests.
- **Runtime Stub Audit & Fixes** — Comprehensive audit of all C/C++ runtime stubs. Fixed `rt_exc_is_exception()` type safety, OOP destructor chaining (derived→base), OOP refcount imbalance (NEW temporary leak), TLS RSA-PSS SHA-384/SHA-512 hashing, bytecode VM missing opcodes, POSIX process isolation timeout, and enabled Windows threading tests.
- **Native PE/COFF Linker Pipeline** — Full Windows native linking without clang. COFF archive (.lib) reader, symbol resolver, section merger, dead-strip pass, ICF, relocation applier with `IMAGE_REL_AMD64` support, and PE executable writer with proper `.idata` import tables. Combined with the v0.2.3 assembler, `viper build` now produces native Windows executables end-to-end with zero external tool dependencies.
- **Zia Language Features** — Seven new features: variadic parameters (`func sum(nums: ...Integer)`), type aliases (`type Name = TargetType;`), shift operators (`<<`, `>>`), compound bitwise assignments (`<<=`, `>>=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`), single-expression functions (`func f(x: T) -> R = expr;`), lambda expressions (`func(params) -> RetType { body }`), and polymorphic `is` expressions that check the full subclass hierarchy.
- **Metal Backend: Feature-Complete** — All 14 backend plans implemented, bringing Metal from 47% to 94% feature parity with the software renderer. GPU skinning, morph targets, shadow mapping, terrain splatting, post-processing, and instanced rendering.
- **D3D11 Backend: 20 Features Implemented** — All 20 D3D11 backend plans implemented in a 3,173-line HLSL+C backend rewrite. Diffuse textures, normal/specular/emissive maps, spot lights, fog, wireframe/cull, render-to-texture, GPU skinning, morph targets (with normal deltas), shadow mapping, instanced rendering, terrain splatting, post-processing (bloom, FXAA, tonemap, DOF, motion blur, SSAO), cubemap skybox, and environment reflections. Windows CI validation job added.
- **Software Renderer Upgrades** — Per-pixel terrain splatting (4-layer weight blend), bilinear filtering, vertex color support, shadow mapping, and material shader hooks (Toon/Fresnel/Emissive shading models).
- **Windows x86_64 Codegen Hardening** — CoffWriter cross-section symbol resolution, X64BinaryEncoder runtime symbol mapping, operand materialisation for TESTrr/call.indirect, SETcc REX prefix for byte registers, SSE RIP-relative MOVSD encoding, unsafe spill slot reuse disabled, and process isolation hang fix. Windows native executables now assemble, link, and run correctly.

VPA binary format with `AssetCompiler` and `VpaWriter` toolchain. `Assets.Load`/`LoadBytes`/`Exists`/`Mount` runtime API. Asset blobs injected into `.rodata` via the native assembler for zero-file-dependency executables. Cross-platform `Path.ExeDir()` for relative asset resolution.
- **XENOSCAPE Demo Rewrite** — Complete rewrite of the flagship Metroid-style sidescroller using all 10 new game engine APIs. 26 Zia files (13K LOC), 10 JSON level files, JSON-driven entity spawning via `LevelData`, composable enemy AI via `Behavior`, and scene management via `SceneManager`.
- **Native macOS Menu Bar** — 554-line Objective-C bridge (`rt_gui_macos_menu.m`) mirrors Viper GUI menubars to the native macOS application menu bar. Special item relocation (About → app menu, Preferences → app menu with Cmd+,, Quit → app menu with Cmd+Q). Keyboard accelerator translation, Services submenu, and Hide/Show All standard items.
- **Bytecode VM CALL_NATIVE Expansion** — Native function index widened from 8-bit to 16-bit (255 → 65,535 max native references) to accommodate the growing runtime. Bytecode format version bumped to v2.
- **Zia Runtime Extern Signatures** — `rtgen` now emits full parameter types (not just return types) for all `RT_FUNC` entries in `ZiaRuntimeExterns.inc`. Enables correct string equality comparison for runtime methods returning `str` (e.g., `LevelData.ObjectType() == "enemy"` now emits `Viper.String.Equals` instead of `ICmpEq`).
- **Zia Language: `entity`/`value` renamed to `class`/`struct`** — Mainstream keyword alignment across all source, tests, REPL, LSP, docs, and VS Code extension.
- **VAPS Packaging Overhaul** — 10 improvements, 57 new tests, Windows installer stub, symlink safety, dry-run mode.
- **Comprehensive Documentation Review** — 39 stale files deleted, 70+ factual errors corrected across 30+ docs, Viper file headers on 100% of 2,706 source files, @brief Doxygen on 98% of runtime functions. Bible code audit across 12 chapters correcting struct field syntax, class method visibility, interface declarations, catch syntax, and collection API calls.

| MTL-14 | Terrain splat | 4-layer weight blend via texture slots 5-9, per-layer UV tiling |

**Metal parity score: 47% → 94%** (32/34 features). Remaining gaps: VBO pooling optimization.

Shared infrastructure changes:
- `vgfx3d_draw_cmd_t` extended with `bone_palette`, `bone_count`, `morph_deltas`, `morph_weights`, `morph_shape_count`
- `vgfx3d_backend_t` gains optional `submit_draw_instanced` vtable entry
- `vgfx3d_postfx_snapshot_t` export API decouples GPU backends from private PostFX structs
- `InstanceBatch3D` dispatches through GPU hook when available, falls back to N individual draws

### Media Codec Suite

From-scratch implementations of 4 new media decoders plus major extensions to existing loaders, all with zero external dependencies. Viper now handles the most common image and audio formats natively.

#### Image Formats

| Format | Capability | Details |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **JPEG** | Load | Baseline DCT, 8-bit, YCbCr/grayscale, 4:4:4/4:2:0/4:2:2, EXIF orientation (auto-rotate), restart markers |
| **PNG** | Load + Save | All 5 color types (grayscale, RGB, indexed, gray+alpha, RGBA), 1/2/4/8/16-bit depths, PLTE/tRNS transparency, Adam7 interlace, proper 16→8 bit rounding |
| **GIF** | Load | GIF87a/89a, LZW decompression, multi-frame animation (up to 64 frames), all 4 disposal methods, interlacing, per-frame delay, transparency, local color tables |
| **BMP** | Load + Save | 24-bit uncompressed (unchanged) |

New API: `Pixels.Load(path)` auto-detects format from magic bytes (PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF). `Sprite.FromFile(path)` extended to support all 4 formats; animated GIFs load all frames with timing.

#### Audio Formats

| Format | Sound FX | Music Stream | Details |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **WAV** | Yes | Yes | 8/16/24/32-bit PCM + 32-bit IEEE float. Any sample rate (resampled to 44100 Hz) |
| **OGG Vorbis** | Yes (full decode) | Yes (streaming) | Vorbis I codec: codebook VQ, floor type 1, multi-pass residue (types 0/1/2), FFT-based IMDCT, stereo coupling. Music streamed with triple-buffer on-the-fly decode |
| **MP3** | Yes (full decode) | Yes (streaming) | MPEG-1/2/2.5 Layer III: Huffman decode (tree-walk for tables 1-6), scalefactors, requantization, anti-alias, IMDCT, polyphase synthesis, MS stereo, bit reservoir. ID3v2 + ID3v1 tag handling. Music streamed per-frame |
| **VAF** | Yes | Block-based | IMA ADPCM 4:1 compression (unchanged) |

Music streaming for OGG and MP3 uses the same triple-buffer architecture as WAV (~96 KB buffer memory regardless of track length). Seamless looping supported for all formats.

New files: `rt_ogg.c/h` (OGG container parser, 276 LOC), `rt_vorbis.c/h` (Vorbis codec, 1100+ LOC), `rt_mp3.c/h` (MP3 decoder, 1000+ LOC), `rt_mp3_tables.h` (spec constants), `rt_gif.c/h` (GIF decoder, 420 LOC).

### Runtime Stub Audit & Bug Fixes

Comprehensive audit of all C/C++ runtime source files identified 21 stubbed or incomplete implementations. Key fixes:

| Issue | Severity | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| `rt_exc_is_exception()` returned true for any non-null pointer | P0 | Proper `rt_obj_class_id() == RT_EXCEPTION_CLASS_ID` check |
| Destructor chaining missing (derived dtor never called base dtor) | P0 | `emitClassDestructor` now emits `call @Base.__dtor` |
| OOP refcount imbalance (NEW objects never reached refcount 0) | P0 | Release NEW temporary after assignment in `lowerLet` |
| TLS RSA-PSS only supported SHA-256 content hashing | P1 | Added SHA-384/SHA-512 via CommonCrypto (macOS) and dlopen'd EVP_Digest (Linux) |
| Bytecode VM missing LOAD_I32, LOAD_STR_MEM, STORE_STR_MEM | P1 | Added threaded-dispatch labels |
| POSIX process isolation had no timeout (blocking waitpid) | P1 | WNOHANG poll loop with clock_gettime + SIGKILL on timeout |
| Windows Viper.Threads test disabled but runtime implemented | P1 | Removed `#ifdef _WIN32 return 0` guard |

---

### Software Renderer Upgrades

- **Per-pixel terrain splatting** — Full 4-layer weight-blended terrain renderer (572+ LOC) sampling splat map RGBA channels with per-layer UV tiling scales
- **NavMesh3D optimization** — Adjacency build from O(n^2) to O(n) via edge hash map
- **Canvas3D framebuffer clear** — uint32 writes instead of per-byte loop (~4x faster at 1080p)
- **Animation crossfade** — TRS decomposition + quaternion SLERP replaces raw matrix lerp (eliminates shear artifacts)

---

### Native PE/COFF Linker Pipeline

Full Windows native linking pipeline, eliminating the clang/link.exe dependency for producing Windows executables. `viper build` now goes from Zia source to `.exe` with zero external tools on all three platforms.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **ArchiveReader** | Reads COFF `.lib` archives, extracts object files and symbol tables |
| **SymbolResolver** | Resolves symbols across object files and archives with on-demand archive member inclusion |
| **SectionMerger** | Merges `.text`, `.rdata`, `.data`, `.bss` sections across objects with alignment padding |
| **DeadStripPass** | Removes unreferenced sections via transitive reachability from entry point |
| **ICF** | Identical Code Folding — deduplicates sections with matching content and relocations |
| **RelocApplier** | Applies `IMAGE_REL_AMD64_*` relocations (ADDR64, ADDR32NB, REL32, SECTION, SECREL) |
| **PeExeWriter** | Produces PE32+ executables with `.idata` import tables, proper section alignment, and optional headers |

CodegenPipeline extended with native link mode: assembles COFF `.obj`, discovers runtime `.lib` archives via `RuntimeComponents`, and invokes the native linker pipeline. Comprehensive tests for all linker passes and PE output validation.

---

### Zia Language Features

Seven new language features expanding Zia's operator, declaration, and parameter surface:

- **Type alias declarations** — `type Name = TargetType;` creates compile-time aliases resolved during semantic analysis. No runtime representation; `typeAliases_` map in Sema, lookup integrated into `resolveNamedType()`.
- **Variadic parameters** — `func sum(nums: ...Integer)` accepts zero or more arguments, collected as `List[Integer]` inside the function body. The lowerer packs excess call-site arguments into a runtime List using `kListNew` + `kListAdd`. Only the last parameter may be variadic.
- **Shift operators** — `<<` (left shift) and `>>` (arithmetic right shift) with correct precedence between additive and comparison. New `parseShift()` precedence level, lowered to `Shl`/`AShr` IL opcodes.
- **Compound bitwise assignments** — `<<=`, `>>=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=` follow the existing compound assignment desugaring pattern (read-op-store).
- **Single-expression functions** — `func f(x: Integer) -> Integer = x * 2;` desugars to a `ReturnStmt` wrapping the body expression. Works for both top-level functions and class methods.
- **Lambda expressions** — `func(params) -> RetType { body }` parsed in expression position when `func` is followed by `(`. Supports typed parameters and optional return type annotation.
- **Polymorphic `is` expressions** — `obj is Base` now returns true when `obj`'s runtime type is `Base` or any subclass of `Base`. `collectDescendants()` walks the class hierarchy, emitting an OR chain of `ICmpEq` comparisons (single comparison optimized for the no-subclass case).

---

### Compiler & Codegen

**Zia frontend:**
- **`entity` → `class`, `value` → `struct`** — Full rename across lexer, parser, sema, lowerer, REPL, LSP, runtime GUI, tests, docs, VS Code extension, and website.
- **Runtime property setter resolution** — Property assignments on runtime class instances (e.g., `ctrl.VY = value`) now call the setter function via symbol lookup. Previously fell through to invalid direct memory writes.
- **String bracket-index crash** — Added `String` case to `lowerIndex()`, emitting `Substring(base, idx, 1)` instead of falling through to the List path.
- **`List[Boolean]` unboxing** — Added `Trunc1` after `kUnboxI1` in `emitUnbox()` to narrow the i64 result back to i1.
- **`catch(e)` binding** — New `rt_throw_msg_set`/`rt_throw_msg_get` TLS runtime functions and `ErrGetMsg` IL opcode. `throw` stores the message, `catch` reads it as a String binding.
- **`String.Contains()` method** — Added `Contains` method alias to the String class mapping to the existing `StrHas` implementation.

**x86_64 backend:**
- **CoffWriter cross-section symbol resolution** — Rodata symbols (`.LC_str_*`) were emitted as undefined in the COFF symbol table, causing LNK2001 linker errors. Rodata symbols now processed first with text relocations redirected to defined entries.
- **X64BinaryEncoder runtime symbol mapping** — External calls used raw IL names (`Viper.Terminal.PrintStr`) instead of C runtime names (`rt_print_str`). Added `mapRuntimeSymbol()` matching the AArch64 pattern.
- **Operand materialisation** — Immediate operands for `TESTrr` (select/cond_br) and `call.indirect` callee now materialised into registers to prevent `bad_variant_access` crashes.
- **SETcc REX prefix** — Correct REX prefix emission for SPL/BPL/SIL/DIL byte registers.
- **SSE RIP-relative loads** — Added `MOVSD` encoding for xmm loads from RIP-relative labels.
- **Spill slot reuse disabled** — Interval analysis did not account for cross-block liveness, causing values still live in successor blocks to be overwritten. All three reuse sites now use the safe `ensureSpillSlot` path.
- **Binary encoder diagnostics** — `bad_variant_access` handler wraps encoding with instruction context for cleaner error reporting.
- **Pipeline error handling** — `pipeline.run()` wrapped in try/catch for cleaner error reporting.

**AArch64 backend:**
- **`i1` parameter masking** — Boolean parameters masked with `AND 1` at function entry, matching return-value masking. Prevents upper-bit garbage corruption.
- **Remove redundant refcount injection** — `emitRefcountedStore` lambda stripped from instruction lowering. String ownership belongs in the IL layer.
- **Immediate utils extraction** — `A64ImmediateUtils.hpp` helper for immediate encoding, asm emitter hardening, binary encoder fixes, arithmetic/call fastpath improvements, regpool and symbol resolver fixes.
- **Trap message forwarding** — `TrapErr` now materialises the message string operand into x0 and passes it to `rt_trap()`, enabling catch handlers to display the user's throw message in native executables.
- **Error field extraction via TLS** — `ErrGetKind`, `ErrGetCode`, and `ErrGetLine` now call runtime TLS accessors (`rt_trap_get_kind/code/line`) instead of returning hardcoded 0. `rt_trap()` auto-classifies the trap kind from the message prefix. Enables typed catch (`catch(e: DivideByZero)`) in native code.
- **Apple M-series scheduler tuning** — Instruction latency model updated for Firestorm cores: FP divide 3→10 cycles, integer divide 3→7, FP multiply 3→4. Improves instruction scheduling for FP-heavy code.

**Native linker:**
- `RtComponent::Game` — Game runtime classes link correctly via `libviper_rt_game.a` after directory reorganization.
- `-lshell32` — Added to Windows linker command for `DragQueryFile`/`DragAcceptFiles` GUI support.

**Runtime:**
- `SetErrorMode` + `_set_abort_behavior` added to `rt_init_stack_safety` on Windows to suppress crash/assert dialog boxes in natively compiled programs.

**Windows test infrastructure:**
- ProcessIsolation framework reworked: function pointers don't survive `CreateProcess`, so `registerChildFunction()` with indexed dispatch (`--viper-child-run=N`) replaces direct pointer passing. `dispatchChild()` added to `TEST_WITH_IL` macro and all 16 VM/conformance tests. Windows test failures reduced from 48 to 4.
- Codegen test assertions accept `.rdata` (Windows COFF) alongside `.rodata` (ELF), `cmovneq`→`cmovne` suffix fix, platform-adaptive paths for RTDiskFullTests, RTNetworkHardenTests, and test_vm_rt_trap_loc.

### 3D Graphics Engine Improvements

#### Terrain System

- **Procedural generation** — `Terrain3D.GeneratePerlin(noise, scale, octaves, persistence)` writes directly to the internal float heightmap from a PerlinNoise object, bypassing the Pixels intermediate for faster terrain generation on large grids
- **LOD (Level of Detail)** — Three resolution levels per chunk (step 1/2/4) selected by distance to camera. `SetLODDistances(near, far)` configures thresholds. Chunks use 578/162/50 vertices at LOD 0/1/2 respectively
- **Frustum culling** — Chunks outside the camera view frustum are skipped entirely using the existing `vgfx3d_frustum_t` infrastructure (Gribb-Hartmann plane extraction + AABB p-vertex/n-vertex test). Per-chunk AABBs computed during mesh generation
- **Skirt geometry** — Downward-facing skirt triangles along chunk edges hide T-junction cracks at LOD boundaries. `SetSkirtDepth(depth)` configures skirt size
- **16-bit heightmap** — R+G channels for 65536 height levels (was 256). `SetSplatMap` + 4 layer textures with per-layer UV tiling, baked blend fallback

#### Water System

- **Gerstner waves** — `Water3D.AddWave(dirX, dirZ, speed, amplitude, wavelength)` adds directional Gerstner waves (up to 8). Multi-wave sum produces realistic ocean-like displacement with proper derivative-based normals
- **Material wiring** — `SetTexture`, `SetNormalMap`, `SetEnvMap`, `SetReflectivity` forward to the underlying Material3D, enabling textured water with environment reflections using zero shader changes
- **Configurable resolution** — `SetResolution(n)` controls grid density (8-256, default 64, up from 32)

#### Vegetation System (New)

- **Vegetation3D** — New runtime class for instanced grass and foliage rendering
- **Cross-billboard blades** — Two perpendicular quads (8 vertices, 4 triangles) per blade instance, eliminating billboard popping from any angle
- **Terrain population** — `Populate(terrain, count)` scatters blades on terrain surface using LCG random, filtered by optional density map (R channel = spawn probability)
- **Wind animation** — Per-blade Y-axis shear via `sin(position + time)`. `SetWindParams(speed, strength, turbulence)` controls wind behavior
- **Distance LOD** — Progressive blade thinning between near/far thresholds + hard cull beyond far. `SetLODDistances(near, far)` configures
- **GPU instancing** — Uses `submit_draw_instanced` backend vtable for single-draw-call rendering of all visible blades. Software fallback for non-GPU backends

#### Material Shader Hooks

- **Shading models** — `Material3D.SetShadingModel(model)` selects per-material shading: 0=BlinnPhong (default), 1=Toon (quantized diffuse bands), 4=Fresnel (angle-dependent alpha), 5=Emissive (boosted glow)
- **Custom parameters** — `Material3D.SetCustomParam(index, value)` passes 8 float parameters to the shader for model-specific tuning (e.g., Toon band count, Fresnel power/bias, Emissive strength)
- **Cross-backend** — Implemented in Metal MSL fragment shader and software rasterizer `compute_lighting()`. OpenGL GLSL and D3D11 HLSL receive the uniforms (shader-side switch deferred)

#### 3D Format Loaders

- **glTF 2.0** — `.gltf` (JSON + external buffers) and `.glb` (single binary container). Mesh extraction with positions, normals, UVs, tangents. PBR metallic-roughness → Blinn-Phong material conversion. Skeletal animation and morph target support
- **STL** — Binary and ASCII auto-detection. Normal computation via `rt_mesh3d_recalc_normals`
- **OBJ .mtl** — Material parser with Kd/Ks/Ns/d properties, texture path resolution relative to OBJ directory, up to 64 materials per file
- **FBX enhancements** — Texture path extraction via Texture node parsing and connection tracing. Morph target extraction from BlendShape/Shape nodes with sparse position/normal deltas
- **Scene3D.Save** — JSON serialization of node hierarchy with transforms

#### Other 3D Improvements

- **Light3D.NewSpot** — Spot light with position, direction, inner/outer cone angles, and smoothstep attenuation
- **Camera3D.NewOrtho** — Orthographic camera for isometric/strategy games
- **Mesh3D.Clear()** — Reset vertex/index counts without freeing backing arrays (enables mesh reuse)
- **Sprite3D use-after-free fix** — Per-frame mesh/material allocation replaced with cached instances + GC temp buffer registration
- **Physics3D shape-specific collision** — Sphere-sphere radial + AABB-sphere closest-point narrow-phase (replaces AABB-only)
- **Physics3D character controller** — Slide-and-step movement replaces trivial velocity-set
- **Physics3D collision events** — `CollisionCount`, `GetCollisionBodyA/B`, `GetCollisionNormal/Depth` queue
- **DistanceJoint3D / SpringJoint3D** — Physics joint constraints with 6-iteration sequential impulse solver
- **Audio3D** — Per-voice `max_distance` tracking table (replaces shared global that caused cross-voice attenuation bugs)
- **SLERP domain clamp** — Prevent NaN from `acosf` with dot products > 1.0 due to rounding
- **Water3D/Decal3D finalizer leaks** — Free mesh/material on GC
- **Metal bone count cap** — Enforce 128-bone limit matching D3D11/OpenGL
- **Cubemap bilinear filtering** — 4-texel interpolation replaces nearest neighbor
- **VIPER_3D_BACKEND env var** — Set `VIPER_3D_BACKEND=software` to force software renderer
- **53 backend implementation plans** — Detailed plans across all 4 renderers (SW: 7, Metal: 14, OpenGL: 16, D3D11: 16) plus 4 additional D3D11 plans

#### Metal Backend: macOS 26 Compatibility

- **Offscreen rendering** — Metal now renders to a `MTLStorageModeManaged` offscreen texture and reads back BGRA pixels to the vgfx software framebuffer (BGRA→RGBA conversion). The existing `drawRect:` CGImage blit path displays the content. This replaces CAMetalLayer direct presentation which broke on macOS 26 (Tahoe)
- **Backend vtable dispatch** — `vgfx3d_show/hide_gpu_layer` moved from duplicate global symbols (Metal `.m` and software `.c` both defined them) to vtable function pointers in `vgfx3d_backend_t`. Fixes SIGSEGV crash when software backend was selected but Metal's version was linked
- **vgfx_set_gpu_present API** — New public API in `vgfx.h` for backends to signal GPU ownership of display (currently unused with offscreen approach but available for future backends)

### New Game Runtime Classes

Five additions to the `Viper.Game` namespace:

- **Timer ms-mode** — `StartMs(durationMs)`, `UpdateMs(dt)`, `ElapsedMs`, `RemainingMs` for delta-time-independent cooldowns
- **Lighting2D** — Darkness overlay with pulsing player light and pooled dynamic point lights
- **PlatformerController** — Jump buffering, coyote time, variable jump height, ground/air acceleration curves, apex gravity bonus
- **AchievementTracker** — Up to 64 achievements with bitmask tracking, 32 stat counters, animated slide-in popups
- **Typewriter** — Character-by-character text reveal with configurable ms-per-character rate

**Runtime directory reorganization**: Game engine classes moved from `src/runtime/collections/` to `src/runtime/game/` (36 files). No API changes.

---

### Game Engine APIs (10 New Systems)

Ten new game engine systems providing high-level abstractions for 2D game development. All implemented as C runtime classes registered via `runtime.def`:

| API | Runtime Class | Key Functions | LOC |
|-----|---------------|---------------|-----|
| **Entity** | `Viper.Game.Entity` | `New`, `ApplyGravity`, `MoveAndCollide`, `UpdatePhysics`, `Overlaps`, `AtEdge`, `PatrolReverse` | 282 |
| **Behavior** | `Viper.Game.Behavior` | `AddPatrol`, `AddChase`, `AddGravity`, `AddEdgeReverse`, `AddShoot`, `AddSineFloat`, `Update` | 227 |
| **Raycast2D** | `Viper.Game.Raycast` | `HasLineOfSight`, `Collision.LineRect`, `Collision.LineCircle` | 124 |
| **LevelData** | `Viper.Game.LevelData` | `Load` (JSON), `ObjectCount`, `ObjectType`, `ObjectX/Y`, `PlayerStartX/Y`, `Theme` | 222 |
| **SceneManager** | `Viper.Game.SceneManager` | `Add`, `Switch`, `SwitchTransition`, `Update`, `Current`, `IsScene` | 183 |
| **Camera.SmoothFollow** | `Viper.Graphics.Camera` | `SmoothFollow(targetX, targetY, speed)`, `SetDeadzone(w, h)` | 45 |
| **AnimStateMachine** | `Viper.Game.AnimStateMachine` | `AddNamed`, `Play(name)`, `StateName`, `SetEventFrame`, `EventFired` | 76 |
| **MenuList.HandleInput** | `Viper.Game.UI.MenuList` | `HandleInput(up, down, confirm)` — returns selected index or -1 | — |
| **Config.Load** | `Viper.Game.Config` | `Load(path)`, `GetString`, `GetInt`, `GetBool`, `GetFloat`, `Has`, `Keys` | 114 |
| **Tilemap.SetTileAnim** | `Viper.Graphics.Tilemap` | `SetTileAnim`, `SetTileAnimFrame`, `UpdateAnims`, `ResolveAnimTile` | 76 |

**Entity** is a lightweight 2D game object with built-in position, velocity, direction, HP, AABB collision flags (ground/left/right/ceiling), and tilemap-aware physics (`MoveAndCollide` performs axis-separated sweep with solid tile detection). **Behavior** provides composable AI presets (patrol, chase, gravity, edge/wall reverse, shoot timer, sine float, anim loop) that can be stacked on any Entity. **LevelData** parses a JSON format with tilemap data, spawn objects (type/id/position), player start position, and theme string — enabling data-driven level design.

**GameButton** (`Viper.Game.UI.GameButton`) also added: styled button widget with customizable colors, border, and text for game menus. 132 LOC.

11 new test binaries covering all game engine APIs: `test_rt_entity`, `test_rt_behavior`, `test_rt_raycast_2d`, `test_rt_scene_manager`, `test_rt_animstate_named`, `test_rt_camera_enhance`, `test_rt_game_menu`, `test_rt_tilemap_anim`, `test_rt_vpa_format`, `test_rt_asset_manager`, `test_rt_path_exe_dir`.

---

### Asset Embedding System (VPA Format)

Compile-time asset packaging for zero-file-dependency native executables. Assets are compiled into a binary blob at build time and embedded into the executable's `.rodata` section.

**Project directives** in `viper.project`:
- `embed <path>` — Embed file as-is (raw bytes)
- `pack <path>` — Pack file with VPA container framing
- `pack-compressed <path>` — Pack with DEFLATE compression

**Toolchain components:**
- `AssetCompiler` (`src/tools/common/asset/AssetCompiler.cpp`, 233 LOC) — Reads project directives, resolves paths, invokes VpaWriter
- `VpaWriter` (`src/tools/common/asset/VpaWriter.cpp`, 230 LOC) — Produces VPA binary format: magic header, file table (name + offset + size + flags), concatenated file data, optional DEFLATE compression
- `VpaReader` (`src/runtime/io/rt_vpa_reader.c`, 375 LOC) — Reads VPA archives at runtime, supports mounting multiple archives
- Asset blob injection — Both x86_64 and AArch64 `CodegenPipeline` inject VPA blobs as `viper_asset_blob` / `viper_asset_blob_size` global symbols in `.rodata`
- `Path.ExeDir()` (`rt_path_exe.c`, 149 LOC) — Cross-platform executable directory resolution (`_NSGetExecutablePath` on macOS, `/proc/self/exe` on Linux, `GetModuleFileName` on Windows)

**Runtime API** (`Viper.IO.Assets`):

| Method | Signature | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `Assets.Load(name)` | `obj(str)` | Load asset as String |
| `Assets.LoadBytes(name)` | `obj(str)` | Load asset as Bytes |
| `Assets.Exists(name)` | `i64(str)` | Check if asset exists |
| `Assets.Size(name)` | `i64(str)` | Get asset size in bytes |
| `Assets.List()` | `obj()` | List all asset names |
| `Assets.Mount(path)` | `i64(str)` | Mount additional VPA archive |
| `Assets.Unmount(path)` | `i64(str)` | Unmount VPA archive |

Asset resolution order: embedded blob → mounted VPA archives → filesystem fallback relative to executable directory. 9 VPA format tests + 9 asset manager tests.

### Native macOS Menu Bar Bridge

New 554-line Objective-C module (`rt_gui_macos_menu.m`) mirrors Viper GUI menubars to the native macOS application menu bar, providing standard macOS application behavior:

- **Special item relocation** — "About" items move to the app menu (prefixed with app name), "Preferences" moves to app menu with Cmd+, accelerator, "Quit"/"Exit" moves to app menu with Cmd+Q
- **Standard app menu items** — Auto-generated About, Services submenu, Hide/Hide Others/Show All, and Quit entries
- **Keyboard accelerator translation** — Viper `Ctrl+` accelerators map to `Cmd+` on macOS; full function key, arrow key, and modifier mapping via `rt_gui_macos_key_equivalent_for_key()`
- **Menu bar suppression** — When `native_main_menu` is active, the Viper-rendered menubar collapses to zero height (no measure/paint/event handling), eliminating double menu bars
- **Key equivalent routing** — macOS event loop now forwards `NSEventTypeKeyDown` to `[mainMenu performKeyEquivalent:]` before Viper input processing, enabling native Cmd+key shortcuts (Cmd+N, F5, etc.)
- **Window and Help menu registration** — Menus titled "Window" and "Help" are registered with `NSApp` for standard macOS behavior (window list, Help search)

Infrastructure changes: `vg_menu_item_t` gains `parent_menu` pointer, `vg_menu` gains `owner_menubar` pointer, `vg_menubar_t` gains `native_main_menu` flag. Accelerator table memory leak fixed in `menubar_destroy`.

### Bytecode VM CALL_NATIVE Expansion

The `CALL_NATIVE` instruction encoding widened to support the growing runtime library:

- **Before:** `[opcode:8][nativeIdx:8][argCount:8]` — max 255 native functions
- **After:** `[opcode:8][argCount:8][nativeIdx:16]` — max 65,535 native functions

Bytecode format version bumped from 1 to 2. Both `BytecodeVM.cpp` (switch dispatch) and `BytecodeVM_threaded.cpp` (threaded dispatch) updated. `BytecodeCompiler` now validates argument count ≤ 255 and native index ≤ 65,535 with clear error messages.

---

### Zia Frontend Improvements

- **Runtime extern parameter types** — `rtgen` now generates full ABI-shaped parameter signatures (not just return types) for all `RT_FUNC` entries in `ZiaRuntimeExterns.inc`. New `ilParamTypeToZiaType()` mapper handles `str`, `i64`, `f64`, `i1`, `obj`, `ptr`, and optional types. This enables Zia sema to correctly identify string-returning runtime methods and emit `Viper.String.Equals` for `==` comparisons instead of `ICmpEq` (which would compare pointer values).
- **`List[Object]` Push ABI fix** — `List.Push` on user-defined class instances now emits the correct 2-argument `(obj, obj)` extern signature. Verified by new `ListEntityPushUsesAbiArity` lowerer test.

---

### VAPS Packaging System

Comprehensive overhaul with 10 improvements:
- Shared `PkgUtils.hpp` (readFile, name normalizers, safeDirectoryIterate)
- Warn on missing icons/assets/invalid versions (eliminate silent failures)
- Symlink safety with root-escape detection in all directory traversals
- `package-category` and `package-depends` manifest directives
- ARM64 Windows PE support (machine type 0xAA64)
- `--dry-run` and `--verbose` CLI modes for package content preview
- Post-build verification (`PkgVerify`) for ZIP, .deb, and PE structural checks
- `.lnk` LinkInfo with VolumeID + LocalBasePath for reliable shortcut resolution
- Windows installer stub architecture (InstallerStubGen x86-64 emitter, IAT wiring, ZipReader)
- Fix DEFLATE double-free crash and `.lnk` missing LinkInfo

57 new packaging tests.

### Video Playback

Video playback for game cutscenes and GUI media applications. All codecs implemented from scratch with zero external dependencies.

#### VideoPlayer Runtime Class

| Member | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Open(path)` | Load video file (`.avi` or `.ogv`) |
| `Play()` / `Pause()` / `Stop()` | Playback control |
| `Seek(seconds)` | Seek to time position |
| `Update(dt)` | Advance by delta time (call each game frame) |
| `SetVolume(vol)` | Audio volume [0.0-1.0] |
| `Width` / `Height` | Frame dimensions (read-only) |
| `Duration` / `Position` | Total and current time in seconds (read-only) |
| `IsPlaying` | Playback active flag (read-only) |
| `Frame` | Current decoded Pixels frame (read-only) |

#### AVI/MJPEG Decoder

- **AVI RIFF container parser** — Walks RIFF chunk tree: `hdrl` (stream headers), `strl`/`strf` (video/audio format), `movi` (interleaved A/V data), `idx1` (index). Identifies video (`XXdc`) and audio (`XXwb`) chunks by FOURCC.
- **MJPEG DHT injection** — AVI MJPEG frames typically omit Huffman tables (DHT markers). Decoder detects missing `0xFFC4` markers and injects the 420-byte standard JPEG Annex K tables (2 DC + 2 AC) before the SOS marker. This enables decoding of MJPEG frames using the existing `rt_jpeg_decode_buffer()`.
- **JPEG buffer decode refactor** — Extracted `rt_jpeg_decode_buffer(data, len)` from file-based `rt_pixels_load_jpeg()` for in-memory frame decoding without file I/O.

#### Theora Codec Infrastructure

- **Header parsing** — Identification (0x80), comment (0x81), and setup (0x82) headers parsed from OGG packets. Extracts frame dimensions, FPS, color space, loop filter limits.
- **YCbCr 4:2:0 → RGBA conversion** — BT.601 integer-only matrix with chroma upsampling. Separate utility (`rt_ycbcr.c`) reusable by future codecs.
- **OGG multi-stream demux** — VideoPlayer detects Theora vs Vorbis streams by packet header signature, routing packets to the correct decoder.
- **Reference frame buffers** — Y/Cb/Cr planes allocated for current, reference, and golden frames. Full DCT/motion compensation decode documented as follow-up.

#### VideoWidget (GUI)

- `VideoWidget.New(parent, path)` — Creates image widget in the GUI widget tree, loads video file internally via VideoPlayer.
- `VideoWidget.Update(dt)` — Advances playback and refreshes the image widget with the current decoded frame.
- Converts Viper Pixels (`uint32 0xRRGGBBAA`) to byte-order RGBA for the `vg_image_set_pixels` GUI path.
- **GUI Image widget paint fix** — Added `image_paint()` vtable function to `vg_image.c` with nearest-neighbor scaled blit to the vgfx framebuffer. Previously, the Image widget stored pixel data but had no rendering code — this fixes `Image.SetPixels()` for all GUI users.

#### Supported Formats

| Container | Video Codec | Audio Codec | Extension | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| AVI (RIFF) | MJPEG | PCM WAV | `.avi` | Full decode |
| OGG | Theora | Vorbis | `.ogv` | Infrastructure (headers + YCbCr) |

### Bug Fixes

- Particle emitter renders with zero alpha from `Color.RGB()` values (alpha byte = 0 treated as opaque)
- Runtime property setter calls on runtime classes (Zia sema symbol lookup)
- `i1` boolean parameter corruption in AArch64 native codegen
- Native linker missing `libviper_rt_game.a` archive (symbol-not-found crash)
- AArch64 string store redundant refcount injection (ownership belongs in IL layer)
- PlatformerController velocity desync after damage knockback, death bounce, enemy stomp
- Sidescroller expansion systems not wired into game loop
- Sprite3D use-after-free: per-frame allocation → cached instances + GC temp buffer
- Metal lit texture bug: diffuse texture only sampled in unlit path
- Metal spot lights fall through to ambient (no cone attenuation)
- Metal texture + sampler recreated every draw call (now cached per-frame)
- Zia `hide final` in class bodies reports clear error instead of generic parse error
- Zia non-constant `final` initializers report V3202 instead of silent drop
- DEFLATE double-free crash in VAPS packaging
- `.lnk` shortcuts missing LinkInfo structure
- Zia string bracket-index crash: `lowerIndex()` missing String case fell through to List path
- Zia `List[Boolean]` unboxing: `kUnboxI1` returned i64, missing `Trunc1` to narrow to i1
- Zia `catch(e)` binding empty: throw now stores message via TLS, catch reads it as String
- Zia `String.Contains()` missing: added method alias to existing `StrHas` implementation
- Windows x86_64 CoffWriter: rodata symbols emitted as undefined causing LNK2001 linker errors
- Windows x86_64 BinaryEncoder: external calls used raw IL names instead of C runtime names
- Windows x86_64 operand materialisation: TESTrr and call.indirect immediate operands caused `bad_variant_access`
- Windows x86_64 SETcc REX prefix: incorrect encoding for SPL/BPL/SIL/DIL byte registers
- Windows x86_64 SSE RIP loads: missing MOVSD encoding for xmm loads from RIP-relative labels
- Windows x86_64 spill slot reuse: interval analysis missed cross-block liveness, overwriting live values
- Windows `CrossLayerArithTests`: missing `dispatchChild()` guard caused infinite process recursion
- Windows crash dialogs suppressed via `SetErrorMode` + `_set_abort_behavior` in `rt_init_stack_safety`
- AArch64 TrapErr: message string operand was discarded, native `throw "msg"` produced empty diagnostics
- AArch64 ErrGetKind/Code/Line: returned hardcoded 0, typed catch (`catch(e: DivideByZero)`) always fell through
- AArch64 scheduler: FP divide modeled at 3 cycles instead of 10, integer divide at 3 instead of 7 — suboptimal instruction ordering
- DllImport aggregate initializer missing `importNames` field (pre-existing `-Wmissing-field-initializers` warning)
- Stale comment in `rt_safe_i64.c` claiming Windows SafeI64 "not yet implemented" (it IS fully implemented)
- `rt_exc_is_exception()` accepted any non-null pointer as an exception (type safety violation)
- OOP destructor chaining: derived class destructors never called base class destructors
- OOP refcount imbalance: `NEW` objects had refcount 2 after assignment (creation ref never released), preventing destruction
- TLS CertificateVerify: RSA-PSS with SHA-384/SHA-512 failed because content hash was always SHA-256
- Bytecode VM: `LOAD_I32`, `LOAD_STR_MEM`, `STORE_STR_MEM` opcodes routed to unimplemented trap handler
- POSIX `ProcessIsolation::runIsolated()` blocked forever on hanging tests (no timeout implemented)
- PNG 16-bit sample downscaling discarded LSB (now uses round-to-nearest)
- MP3 ID3v1 tags at end of file could corrupt last decoded frame
- `vg_image_load_file()` GUI widget stub always returned false (now wired to `rt_pixels` decoders)
- Mach-O linker: `rt_audio_shutdown` exported as dynamic symbol but defined as weak stub, causing link failures on some configurations
- Metal backend: CAMetalLayer presentation broken on macOS 26 Tahoe — replaced with offscreen texture readback
- Metal backend clear color alpha: was 0.0 when PostFX inactive (transparent layer), now always 1.0
- Software 3D backend crash: `vgfx3d_show_gpu_layer` duplicate symbol — Metal version called with software context, sending `metalLayer` objc message to garbage memory (SIGSEGV). Fixed via vtable dispatch
- `drawRect:` CGImage blit covered Metal layer content every frame on macOS — software framebuffer overwriting GPU-rendered content
- Water3D wave normals: single sine wave normal used `dydz = dydx` (identical derivatives), producing incorrect normals for diagonal wave propagation. Gerstner model computes per-direction derivatives correctly
- GUI Image widget: `vg_image_t` stored pixel data via `SetPixels()` but had no vtable paint function — image content never rendered. Added `image_paint()` with nearest-neighbor scaled blit to framebuffer
- MJPEG AVI decode: frames missing DHT Huffman tables caused JPEG decode failure (returned NULL). Added automatic injection of standard Annex K DHT tables before SOS marker
- Zia runtime extern signatures only included return type — string-returning methods like `LevelData.ObjectType()` compared as pointer equality instead of string equality. `rtgen` now emits full parameter types
- Zia `List[Object].Push()` emitted wrong extern arity for user-defined class instances
- GUI menubar accelerator table leaked on destroy (missing free loop in `menubar_destroy`)
- macOS key equivalents (Cmd+N, F5) not consumed by native menu bar — arrow keys triggered system beep for unhandled navigation
