# CODEMAP: Codegen

- **src/codegen/x86_64/placeholder.cpp**

  Serves as the minimal translation unit anchoring the x86-64 code generation library so the component builds into a linkable object. It defines a stub `placeholder` function that returns zero, preserving the namespace until real emission stages arrive. The file includes nothing and therefore depends solely on the C++ core language, making it an isolated scaffold for future codegen work.
